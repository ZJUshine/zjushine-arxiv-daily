## LLM Security and Privacy

[LLM Security Guard for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01103) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-03 **Authors** Arya Kavian et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Many developers rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate software development. Nevertheless, these models have exhibited limited capabilities in the security domain. We introduce LLMSecGuard, a framework to offer enhanced code security through the synergy between static code analyzers and LLMs. LLMSecGuard is open source and aims to equip developers with code solutions that are more secure than the code initially generated by LLMs. This framework also has a benchmarking feature, aimed at providing insights into the evolving security attributes of these models. <br /> <br />[Investigating the prompt leakage effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16251) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-26 **Authors** Divyansh Agarwal et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompt leakage in large language models (LLMs) poses a significant security and privacy threat, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, leakage in multi-turn LLM interactions along with mitigation strategies has not been studied in a standardized manner. This paper investigates LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage across 4 diverse domains and 10 closed- and open-source LLMs. Our unique multi-turn threat model leverages the LLM's sycophancy effect and our analysis dissects task instruction and knowledge leakage in the LLM response. In a multi-turn setting, our threat model elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) to 86.2%, including a 99% leakage with GPT-4 and claude-1.3. We find that some black-box LLMs like Gemini show variable susceptibility to leakage across domains - they are more likely to leak contextual knowledge in the news domain compared to the medical domain. Our experiments measure specific effects of 6 black-box defense strategies, including a query-rewriter in the RAG scenario. Our proposed multi-tier combination of defenses still has an ASR of 5.3% for black-box LLMs, indicating room for enhancement and future direction for LLM security research. <br /> <br />[CyberSecEval 2: A Wide-Ranging Cybersecurity Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13161) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-19 **Authors** Manish Bhatt et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) introduce new security risks, but there are few comprehensive evaluation suites to measure and reduce these risks. We present BenchmarkName, a novel benchmark to quantify LLM security risks and capabilities. We introduce two new areas for testing: prompt injection and code interpreter abuse. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, including GPT-4, Mistral, Meta Llama 3 70B-Instruct, and Code Llama. Our results show that conditioning away risk of attack remains an unsolved problem; for example, all tested models showed between 26% and 41% successful prompt injection tests. We further introduce the safety-utility tradeoff: conditioning an LLM to reject unsafe prompts can cause the LLM to falsely reject answering benign prompts, which lowers utility. We propose quantifying this tradeoff using False Refusal Rate (FRR). As an illustration, we introduce a novel test set to quantify FRR for cyberattack helpfulness risk. We find many LLMs able to successfully comply with "borderline" benign requests while still rejecting most unsafe requests. Finally, we quantify the utility of LLMs for automating a core cybersecurity task, that of exploiting software vulnerabilities. This is important because the offensive capabilities of LLMs are of intense interest; we quantify this by creating novel test sets for four representative problems. We find that models with coding capabilities perform better than those without, but that further work is needed for LLMs to become proficient at exploit generation. Our code is open source and can be used to evaluate other LLMs. <br /> <br />[Private Attribute Inference from Images with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10618) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-16 **Authors** Batuhan Tömekçe et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses. <br /> <br />[Unveiling the Misuse Potential of Base Large Language Models via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10552) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-16 **Authors** Xiao Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The open-sourcing of large language models (LLMs) accelerates application development, innovation, and scientific progress. This includes both base models, which are pre-trained on extensive datasets without alignment, and aligned models, deliberately designed to align with ethical standards and human values. Contrary to the prevalent assumption that the inherent instruction-following limitations of base LLMs serve as a safeguard against misuse, our investigation exposes a critical oversight in this belief. By deploying carefully designed demonstrations, our research demonstrates that base LLMs could effectively interpret and execute malicious instructions. To systematically assess these risks, we introduce a novel set of risk evaluation metrics. Empirical results reveal that the outputs from base LLMs can exhibit risk levels on par with those of models fine-tuned for malicious purposes. This vulnerability, requiring neither specialized knowledge nor training, can be manipulated by almost anyone, highlighting the substantial risk and the critical need for immediate attention to the base LLMs' security protocols. <br /> <br />[Subtoxic Questions: Dive Into Attitude Change of LLM's Response in Jailbreak Attempts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08309) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-12 **Authors** Tianyu Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by focusing on a set of target questions that are inherently more sensitive to jailbreak prompts, aiming to circumvent the limitations posed by enhanced LLM security. Through designing and analyzing these sensitive questions, this paper reveals a more effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, thereby contributing to the advancement of LLM security. This research not only challenges existing jailbreaking methodologies but also fortifies LLMs against potential exploits. <br /> <br />[Mapping LLM Security Landscapes: A Comprehensive Stakeholder Risk Assessment Proposal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13309) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Rahul Pankajakshan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse sectors has marked a transformative era, showcasing remarkable capabilities in text generation and problem-solving tasks. However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities. Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences. Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology. To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems. We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors. Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix. We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users. The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies. Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security. <br /> <br />[Ensuring Safe and High-Quality Outputs: A Guideline Library Approach for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11838) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-23 **Authors** Yi Luo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but also present risks such as biased content generation and privacy issues. One of the current alignment techniques includes principle-driven integration, but it faces challenges arising from the imprecision of manually crafted rules and inadequate risk perception in models without safety training. To address these, we introduce Guide-Align, a two-stage approach. Initially, a safety-trained model identifies potential risks and formulates specific guidelines for various inputs, establishing a comprehensive library of guidelines and a model for input-guidelines retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval model correlates new inputs with relevant guidelines, which guide LLMs in response generation to ensure safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. An additional optional stage involves fine-tuning a model with well-aligned datasets generated through the process implemented in the second stage. Our method customizes guidelines to accommodate diverse inputs, thereby enhancing the fine-grainedness and comprehensiveness of the guideline library. Furthermore, it incorporates safety expertise from a safety-trained LLM through a lightweight retrieval model. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM security and quality. Notably, our fine-tuned model, Labrador, even at 13 billion parameters, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses GPT-4 in alignment capabilities. <br /> <br />[Tastle: Distract Large Language Models for Automatic Jailbreak Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08424) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-13 **Authors** Zeguan Xiao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in recent days. Extensive efforts have been made before the public release of LLMs to align their behaviors with human values. The primary goal of alignment is to ensure their helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness. However, even meticulously aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious manipulations such as jailbreaking, leading to unintended behaviors. The jailbreak is to intentionally develop a malicious prompt that escapes from the LLM security restrictions to produce uncensored detrimental contents. Previous works explore different jailbreak methods for red teaming LLMs, yet they encounter challenges regarding to effectiveness and scalability. In this work, we propose Tastle, a novel black-box jailbreak framework for automated red teaming of LLMs. We designed malicious content concealing and memory reframing with an iterative optimization algorithm to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research about the distractibility and over-confidence phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments of jailbreaking both open-source and proprietary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability and transferability. We also evaluate the effectiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods against our attack and highlight the crucial need to develop more effective and practical defense strategies. <br /> <br />[On Protecting the Data Privacy of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05156) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-14 **Authors** Biwei Yan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) are complex artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding, generating and translating human language. They learn language patterns by analyzing large amounts of text data, allowing them to perform writing, conversation, summarizing and other language tasks. When LLMs process and generate large amounts of data, there is a risk of leaking sensitive information, which may threaten data privacy. This paper concentrates on elucidating the data privacy concerns associated with LLMs to foster a comprehensive understanding. Specifically, a thorough investigation is undertaken to delineate the spectrum of data privacy threats, encompassing both passive privacy leakage and active privacy attacks within LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct an assessment of the privacy protection mechanisms employed by LLMs at various stages, followed by a detailed examination of their efficacy and constraints. Finally, the discourse extends to delineate the challenges encountered and outline prospective directions for advancement in the realm of LLM privacy protection. <br /> <br />[A New Era in LLM Security: Exploring Security Concerns in Real-World LLM-based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18649) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Fangzhou Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on. Along with the great potential, there are also increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent systems. However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on). In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the individual LLMs. To do so, we build on top of the information flow and formulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects. Based on this construction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints. To ground this new attack surface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4. Our investigation exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components. We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has designed numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these safety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers. To further demonstrate the real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an end-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat history, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct access to OpenAI GPT4. Our demo is in the link: https://fzwark.github.io/LLM-System-Attack-Demo/ <br /> <br />[Making Them Ask and Answer: Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Few Queries via Disguise and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18104) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Tong Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable success across various tasks, but the trustworthiness of LLMs is still an open problem. One specific threat is the potential to generate toxic or harmful responses. Attackers can craft adversarial prompts that induce harmful responses from LLMs. In this work, we pioneer a theoretical foundation in LLMs security by identifying bias vulnerabilities within the safety fine-tuning and design a black-box jailbreak method named DRA (Disguise and Reconstruction Attack), which conceals harmful instructions through disguise and prompts the model to reconstruct the original harmful instruction within its completion. We evaluate DRA across various open-source and close-source models, showcasing state-of-the-art jailbreak success rates and attack efficiency. Notably, DRA boasts a 90\% attack success rate on LLM chatbots GPT-4. <br /> <br />[Is the System Message Really Important to Jailbreaks in Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14857) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Xiaotian Zou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has rendered them indispensable in modern society. While security measures are typically in place to align LLMs with human values prior to release, recent studies have unveiled a concerning phenomenon named "jailbreak." This term refers to the unexpected and potentially harmful responses generated by LLMs when prompted with malicious questions. Existing research focuses on generating jailbreak prompts but our study aim to answer a different question: Is the system message really important to jailbreak in LLMs? To address this question, we conducted experiments in a stable GPT version gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to generated jailbreak prompts with varying system messages: short, long, and none. We discover that different system messages have distinct resistances to jailbreak by experiments. Additionally, we explore the transferability of jailbreak across LLMs. This finding underscores the significant impact system messages can have on mitigating LLMs jailbreak. To generate system messages that are more resistant to jailbreak prompts, we propose System Messages Evolutionary Algorithms (SMEA). Through SMEA, we can get robust system messages population that demonstrate up to 98.9% resistance against jailbreak prompts. Our research not only bolsters LLMs security but also raises the bar for jailbreak, fostering advancements in this field of study. <br /> <br />[LLM Jailbreak Attack versus Defense Techniques -- A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13457) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-21 **Authors** Zihao Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMS) have increasingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts. Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security. We believe these contributions will facilitate the exploration of security measures within this domain. <br /> <br />[StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Sizhe Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model to deviate from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate the prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/PromptInjectionDefense. <br /> <br />[Studious Bob Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Yichuan Mo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to certain prompts that can induce them to bypass built-in safety measures and provide dangerous or illegal content, a phenomenon known as jailbreak. To protect LLMs from producing harmful information, various defense strategies are proposed, with most focusing on content filtering or adversarial training of models. In this paper, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) to train a defense control mechanism, which is then embedded as a prefix to user prompts to implement our defense strategy. We design a training process similar to adversarial training to achieve our optimized goal, alternating between updating attack and defense controls. To our knowledge, we are the first to implement defense from the perspective of prompt tuning. Once employed, our method will hardly impact the operational efficiency of LLMs. Experiments show that our method is effective in both black-box and white-box settings, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0 while maintaining the benign answer rate of 80% to simple benign questions. Our work might potentially chart a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security. <br /> <br />[Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12192) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-16 **Authors** Yiyi Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Textual data is often represented as realnumbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be vulnerable to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages vulnerable to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, and thoroughly explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings. <br /> <br />[A Comprehensive Survey of Attack Techniques, Implementation, and Mitigation Strategies in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10982) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-18 **Authors** Aysan Esmradi et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) is an ongoing challenge despite their widespread popularity. Developers work to enhance LLMs security, but vulnerabilities persist, even in advanced versions like GPT-4. Attackers exploit these weaknesses, highlighting the need for proactive cybersecurity measures in AI model development. This article explores two attack categories: attacks on models themselves and attacks on model applications. The former requires expertise, access to model data, and significant implementation time, while the latter is more accessible to attackers and has seen increased attention. Our study reviews over 100 recent research works, providing an in-depth analysis of each attack type. We identify the latest attack methods and explore various approaches to carry them out. We thoroughly investigate mitigation techniques, assessing their effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize future defenses against these attacks. We also examine real-world techniques, including reported and our implemented attacks on LLMs, to consolidate our findings. Our research highlights the urgency of addressing security concerns and aims to enhance the understanding of LLM attacks, contributing to robust defense development in this evolving domain. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Privacy: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02003) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Yifan Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into "The Good" (beneficial LLM applications), "The Bad" (offensive applications), and "The Ugly" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity. <br /> <br />[Reducing Privacy Risks in Online Self-Disclosures with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09538) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Yao Dou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Self-disclosure, while being common and rewarding in social media interaction, also poses privacy risks. In this paper, we take the initiative to protect the user-side privacy associated with online self-disclosure through detection and abstraction. We develop a taxonomy of 19 self-disclosure categories and curate a large corpus consisting of 4.8K annotated disclosure spans. We then fine-tune a language model for detection, achieving over 65% partial span F $_1$ . We further conduct an HCI user study, with 82% of participants viewing the model positively, highlighting its real-world applicability. Motivated by the user feedback, we introduce the task of self-disclosure abstraction, which is paraphrasing disclosures into less specific terms while preserving their utility, e.g., "Im 16F" to "I'm a teenage girl". We explore various fine-tuning strategies, and our best model can generate diverse abstractions that moderately reduce privacy risks while maintaining high utility according to human evaluation. To help users in deciding which disclosures to abstract, we present a task of rating their importance for context understanding. Our fine-tuned model achieves 80% accuracy, on-par with GPT-3.5. Given safety and privacy considerations, we will only release our corpus to researchers who agree to ethical guidelines. <br /> <br />[Prompt Packer: Deceiving LLMs through Compositional Instruction with Hidden Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10077) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-16 **Authors** Shuyu Jiang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with powerful general capabilities have been increasingly integrated into various Web applications, while undergoing alignment training to ensure that the generated content aligns with user intent and ethics. Unfortunately, they remain the risk of generating harmful content like hate speech and criminal activities in practical applications. Current approaches primarily rely on detecting, collecting, and training against harmful prompts to prevent such risks. However, they typically focused on the "superficial" harmful prompts with a solitary intent, ignoring composite attack instructions with multiple intentions that can easily elicit harmful content in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique for obfuscating harmful instructions: Compositional Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless intentions, making it impossible for the model to identify underlying malicious intentions. Furthermore, we implement two transformation methods, known as T-CIA and W-CIA, to automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing tasks, making them appear harmless to LLMs. We evaluated CIA on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and ChatGLM2 with two safety assessment datasets and two harmful prompt datasets. It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and 83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful prompt datasets. Our approach reveals the vulnerability of LLMs to such compositional instruction attacks that harbor underlying harmful intentions, contributing significantly to LLM security development. Warning: this paper may contain offensive or upsetting content! <br /> <br />[Beyond Memorization: Violating Privacy Via Inference with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07298) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-06 **Authors** Robin Staab et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models' inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals' privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to $85\%$ top-1 and $95\%$ top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost ($100\times$) and time ($240\times$ ) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection. <br /> <br />[Baseline Defenses for Adversarial Attacks Against Aligned Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-04 **Authors** Neel Jain et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision?   We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision. <br /> <br />[Multi-step Jailbreaking Privacy Attacks on ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05197) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-01 **Authors** Haoran Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), many downstream NLP tasks can be well solved given appropriate prompts. Though model developers and researchers work hard on dialog safety to avoid generating harmful content from LLMs, it is still challenging to steer AI-generated content (AIGC) for the human good. As powerful LLMs are devouring existing text data from various domains (e.g., GPT-3 is trained on 45TB texts), it is natural to doubt whether the private information is included in the training data and what privacy threats can these LLMs and their downstream applications bring. In this paper, we study the privacy threats from OpenAI's ChatGPT and the New Bing enhanced by ChatGPT and show that application-integrated LLMs may cause new privacy threats.

## LLM Applications

[PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06823) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-14 **Authors** Bo Hui et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness.   In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt.   We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak. <br /> <br />[XAI4LLM. Let Machine Learning Models and LLMs Collaborate for Enhanced In-Context Learning in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06270) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-15 **Authors** Fatemeh Nazary et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts.   Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.   This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Risks of Practicing Large Language Models in Smart Grid: Threat Modeling and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06237) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-10 **Authors** Jiangnan Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Model (LLM) is a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) and holds considerable potential for application within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of LLMs and identify two major types of attacks relevant to smart grid LLM applications, along with presenting the corresponding threat models. We then validate these attacks using popular LLMs, utilizing real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in smart grid scenarios. <br /> <br />[A Fourth Wave of Open Data? Exploring the Spectrum of Scenarios for Open Data and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04333) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-07 **Authors** Hannah Chafetz et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Since late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, with widespread use of tools including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Generative AI and large language model (LLM) applications are transforming how individuals find and access data and knowledge. However, the intricate relationship between open data and generative AI, and the vast potential it holds for driving innovation in this field remain underexplored areas. This white paper seeks to unpack the relationship between open data and generative AI and explore possible components of a new Fourth Wave of Open Data: Is open data becoming AI ready? Is open data moving towards a data commons approach? Is generative AI making open data more conversational? Will generative AI improve open data quality and provenance? Towards this end, we provide a new Spectrum of Scenarios framework. This framework outlines a range of scenarios in which open data and generative AI could intersect and what is required from a data quality and provenance perspective to make open data ready for those specific scenarios. These scenarios include: pertaining, adaptation, inference and insight generation, data augmentation, and open-ended exploration. Through this process, we found that in order for data holders to embrace generative AI to improve open data access and develop greater insights from open data, they first must make progress around five key areas: enhance transparency and documentation, uphold quality and integrity, promote interoperability and standards, improve accessibility and useability, and address ethical considerations. <br /> <br />[When LLMs Meet Cybersecurity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03644) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-06 **Authors** Jie Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an ever-evolving threat landscape and need for innovative technologies.

This survey offers a detailed exploration of the methodologies, applications, challenges, and forward-looking opportunities of LLMs within these high-stakes sectors. We highlight the instrumental role of LLMs in enhancing diagnostic and treatment methodologies in healthcare, innovating financial analytics, and refining legal interpretation and compliance strategies. Moreover, we critically examine the ethics for LLM applications in these fields, pointing out the existing ethical concerns and the need for transparent, fair, and robust AI systems that respect regulatory norms. By presenting a thorough review of current literature and practical applications, we showcase the transformative impact of LLMs, and outline the imperative for interdisciplinary cooperation, methodological advancements, and ethical vigilance. Through this lens, we aim to spark dialogue and inspire future research dedicated to maximizing the benefits of LLMs while mitigating their risks in these precision-dependent sectors. To facilitate future research on LLMs in these critical societal domains, we also initiate a reading list that tracks the latest advancements under this topic, which will be continually updated: \url{https://github.com/czyssrs/LLM_X_papers}. <br /> <br />[RepEval: Effective Text Evaluation with LLM Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19563) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-30 **Authors** Shuqian Sheng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Automatic evaluation metrics for generated texts play an important role in the NLG field, especially with the rapid growth of LLMs. However, existing metrics are often limited to specific scenarios, making it challenging to meet the evaluation requirements of expanding LLM applications. Therefore, there is a demand for new, flexible, and effective metrics. In this study, we introduce RepEval, the first metric leveraging the projection of LLM representations for evaluation. RepEval requires minimal sample pairs for training, and through simple prompt modifications, it can easily transition to various tasks. Results on ten datasets from three tasks demonstrate the high effectiveness of our method, which exhibits stronger correlations with human judgments compared to previous metrics, even outperforming GPT-4. Our work underscores the richness of information regarding text quality embedded within LLM representations, offering insights for the development of new metrics. <br /> <br />[Generating Situated Reflection Triggers about Alternative Solution Paths: A Case Study of Generative AI for Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18262) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-28 **Authors** Atharva Naik et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> An advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their contextualization capability - providing different responses based on student inputs like solution strategy or prior discussion, to potentially better engage students than standard feedback. We present a design and evaluation of a proof-of-concept LLM application to offer students dynamic and contextualized feedback. Specifically, we augment an Online Programming Exercise bot for a college-level Cloud Computing course with ChatGPT, which offers students contextualized reflection triggers during a collaborative query optimization task in database design. We demonstrate that LLMs can be used to generate highly situated reflection triggers that incorporate details of the collaborative discussion happening in context. We discuss in depth the exploration of the design space of the triggers and their correspondence with the learning objectives as well as the impact on student learning in a pilot study with 34 students. <br /> <br />[Human-Imperceptible Retrieval Poisoning Attacks in LLM-Powered Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17196) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-26 **Authors** Quan Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Presently, with the assistance of advanced LLM application development frameworks, more and more LLM-powered applications can effortlessly augment the LLMs' knowledge with external content using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, these frameworks' designs do not have sufficient consideration of the risk of external content, thereby allowing attackers to undermine the applications developed with these frameworks. In this paper, we reveal a new threat to LLM-powered applications, termed retrieval poisoning, where attackers can guide the application to yield malicious responses during the RAG process. Specifically, through the analysis of LLM application frameworks, attackers can craft documents visually indistinguishable from benign ones. Despite the documents providing correct information, once they are used as reference sources for RAG, the application is misled into generating incorrect responses. Our preliminary experiments indicate that attackers can mislead LLMs with an 88.33\% success rate, and achieve a 66.67\% success rate in the real-world application, demonstrating the potential impact of retrieval poisoning. <br /> <br />[A Comprehensive Survey on Evaluating Large Language Model Applications in the Medical Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15777) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-05 **Authors** Yining Huang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Since the inception of the Transformer architecture in 2017, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT have evolved significantly, impacting various industries with their advanced capabilities in language understanding and generation.

Our investigation focuses on LLMs developed post-GPT-3.5, primarily in text-based modalities while also considering multimodal approaches for perception and control. We offer comprehensive guidelines and examples for prompt engineering, facilitating beginners' access to LLM-based robotics solutions. Through tutorial-level examples and structured prompt construction, we illustrate how LLM-guided enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into robotics applications. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of LLM-driven robotics, offering a comprehensive overview and practical guidance for harnessing the power of language models in robotics development. <br /> <br />[GoEX: Perspectives and Designs Towards a Runtime for Autonomous LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06921) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-10 **Authors** Shishir G. Patil et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services. Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future. We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting. The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks. Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement. We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/. <br /> <br />[Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-18 **Authors** Cangqing Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inaugurated a transformative epoch in natural language processing, fostering unprecedented proficiency in text generation, comprehension, and contextual scrutiny. Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models' context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs' efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions. <br /> <br />[Towards Responsible and Reliable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-21 **Authors** Xusen Guo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and responsibility in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Responsible and Reliable Traffic flow forecasting model with Large Language Models (R2T-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate responsible traffic predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, R2T-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, R2T-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for conditional future flow forecasting, showcasing R2T-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing accountable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for accountable and reliable prediction of traffic flows. <br /> <br />[Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16159) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-05 **Authors** Siyu Zha et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that is very helpful in nurturing students' creativity, but it requires significant time and energy from both students and teachers. Large language models (LLMs) have been proven to assist in creative tasks, yet much controversy exists regarding their role in fostering creativity. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL settings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an exploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five design considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we developed an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional experiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can enhance every stage of PBL. Additionally, we also discovered ambivalent perspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we explored the challenge and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and reflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational practice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into harnessing AI's potential in child-centric educational settings. <br /> <br />[The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-26 **Authors** Hannah R. Lawrence et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-11 **Authors** Zheyuan He et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools across various domains within cyber security. Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS).   Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security.

However, inherent biases stemming from predominantly English-centric pre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to complexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for pre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have been established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a comprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse benchmarks, including open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar studies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in prior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2. Specifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108 languages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective multilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with pre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity. <br /> <br />[Do Large Language Model Understand Multi-Intent Spoken Language ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04481) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-15 **Authors** Shangjian Yin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This research signifies a considerable breakthrough in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU). Our approach re-imagines the use of entity slots in multi-intent SLU applications, making the most of the generative potential of LLMs within the SLU landscape, leading to the development of the EN-LLM series. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of Sub-Intent Instruction (SII) to amplify the analysis and interpretation of complex, multi-intent communications, which further supports the creation of the ENSI-LLM models series. Our novel datasets, identified as LM-MixATIS and LM-MixSNIPS, are synthesized from existing benchmarks. The study evidences that LLMs may match or even surpass the performance of the current best multi-intent SLU models. We also scrutinize the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of intent configurations and dataset distributions. On top of this, we present two revolutionary metrics - Entity Slot Accuracy (ESA) and Combined Semantic Accuracy (CSA) - to facilitate a detailed assessment of LLM competence in this multifaceted field."

A lot of high-quality text data generated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a promising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP finetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source LLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion models. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and generate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP finetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe. <br /> <br />[SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards Oracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-16 **Authors** Jiahuan Yan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive zero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch. Reversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its zero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative process. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly annotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold labels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model attains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical datasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the potential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training vertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations. <br /> <br />[AutoRD: An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontologies-enhanced Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00953) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-01 **Authors** Lang Cao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Objectives: Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates extracting information from clinical text about rare diseases. We have conducted various tests to evaluate the performance of AutoRD and highlighted its strengths and limitations in this paper.   Materials and Methods: Our system, AutoRD, is a software pipeline involving data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implement this using large language models and medical knowledge graphs developed from open-source medical ontologies. We quantitatively evaluate our system on entity extraction, relation extraction, and the performance of knowledge graph construction.   Results: AutoRD achieves an overall F1 score of 47.3%, a 14.4% improvement compared to the base LLM. In detail, AutoRD achieves an overall entity extraction F1 score of 56.1% (rare_disease: 83.5%, disease: 35.8%, symptom_and_sign: 46.1%, anaphor: 67.5%) and an overall relation extraction F1 score of 38.6% (produces: 34.7%, increases_risk_of: 12.4%, is_a: 37.4%, is_acronym: 44.1%, is_synonym: 16.3%, anaphora: 57.5%). Our qualitative experiment also demonstrates that the performance in constructing the knowledge graph is commendable.   Discussion: AutoRD demonstrates the potential of LLM applications in rare disease detection. This improvement is attributed to several design, including the integration of ontologies-enhanced LLMs.   Conclusion: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs. It uses ontologies-enhanced LLMs for a robust medical knowledge base. The superior performance of AutoRD is validated by experimental evaluations, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in healthcare. <br /> <br />[TroubleLLM: Align to Red Team Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00829) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Zhuoer Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) become the start-of-the-art solutions for a variety of natural language tasks and are integrated into real-world applications. However, LLMs can be potentially harmful in manifesting undesirable safety issues like social biases and toxic content. It is imperative to assess its safety issues before deployment. However, the quality and diversity of test prompts generated by existing methods are still far from satisfactory. Not only are these methods labor-intensive and require large budget costs, but the controllability of test prompt generation is lacking for the specific testing domain of LLM applications. With the idea of LLM for LLM testing, we propose the first LLM, called TroubleLLM, to generate controllable test prompts on LLM safety issues. Extensive experiments and human evaluation illustrate the superiority of TroubleLLM on generation quality and generation controllability. <br /> <br />[LLMGuard: Guarding Against Unsafe LLM Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00826) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-27 **Authors** Shubh Goyal et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Although the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise settings brings new opportunities and capabilities, it also brings challenges, such as the risk of generating inappropriate, biased, or misleading content that violates regulations and can have legal concerns. To alleviate this, we present "LLMGuard", a tool that monitors user interactions with an LLM application and flags content against specific behaviours or conversation topics. To do this robustly, LLMGuard employs an ensemble of detectors. <br /> <br />[PRSA: Prompt Reverse Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-29 **Authors** Yong Yang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompt, recognized as crucial intellectual property, enables large language models (LLMs) to perform specific tasks without the need of fine-tuning, underscoring their escalating importance. With the rise of prompt-based services, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers often display prompts' capabilities through input-output examples to attract users. However, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure of input-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on the intellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problem still has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in this paper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attack framework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA. The main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of the input-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. In detail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt pruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based on differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectively inferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and mask the words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodate diverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify that PRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios. We have reported these findings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to take protective measures for prompt copyright. <br /> <br />[Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-26 **Authors** Paul Röttger et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for Personal Mobility Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-22 **Authors** Jiawei Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich activity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is performed using real-world data. This research marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis. <br /> <br />[An Evaluation of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13714) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-21 **Authors** Hengchuang Yin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have gained considerable interest across diverse research communities. Their notable ability for text completion and generation has inaugurated a novel paradigm for language-interfaced problem solving. However, the potential and efficacy of these models in bioinformatics remain incompletely explored. In this work, we study the performance LLMs on a wide spectrum of crucial bioinformatics tasks. These tasks include the identification of potential coding regions, extraction of named entities for genes and proteins, detection of antimicrobial and anti-cancer peptides, molecular optimization, and resolution of educational bioinformatics problems. Our findings indicate that, given appropriate prompts, LLMs like GPT variants can successfully handle most of these tasks. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of their limitations in the context of complicated bioinformatics tasks. In conclusion, we believe that this work can provide new perspectives and motivate future research in the field of LLMs applications, AI for Science and bioinformatics. <br /> <br />[Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13659) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-21 **Authors** Da Yu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user instructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with users' intentions. These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive information, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new privacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we propose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data annotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by generating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators. Crucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that matches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real ones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final set of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real instructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic instructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna. <br /> <br />[Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-18 **Authors** Zining Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging conversation. However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on scripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations. This paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models (LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations. We introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to generate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's personality. We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a text-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a library of physical actions for the robot. We develop a custom, state-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's tone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot actions. A demo of our system is available here. To illuminate design and implementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a social robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback, conducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy, helpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment. Most negative feedback was due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on conversations. However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM repeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses, that have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for LLM application. <br /> <br />[Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence Chatbots in Ophthalmology and LLM-based evaluation using GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10083) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-15 **Authors** Ting Fang Tan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician experts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient queries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology questions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent commonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and testing (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b, LLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset, additional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing dataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized clinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on clinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4 evaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical alignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest (87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%), LLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4 evaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings, with Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80 respectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50. Notably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical inaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately identified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment of GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical evaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By complementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient and automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in LLM applications for healthcare. <br /> <br />[Unmemorization in Large Language Models via Self-Distillation and Deliberate Imagination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10052) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-15 **Authors** Yijiang River Dong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> While displaying impressive generation capabilities across many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with crucial issues of privacy violation and unwanted exposure of sensitive data. This raises an essential question: how should we prevent such undesired behavior of LLMs while maintaining their strong generation and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities? In this work, we introduce a novel approach termed deliberate imagination in the context of LLM unlearning. Instead of trying to forget memorized data, we employ a self-distillation framework, guiding LLMs to deliberately imagine alternative scenarios. As demonstrated in a wide range of experiments, the proposed method not only effectively unlearns targeted text but also preserves the LLMs' capabilities in open-ended generation tasks as well as in NLU tasks. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach across different models and sizes, and also with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering a novel pathway to addressing the challenges with private and sensitive data in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Anchor-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07616) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-16 **Authors** Jianhui Pang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications. <br /> <br />[T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-12 **Authors** Masoomali Fatehkia et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities fueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of domains. An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model Hallucination via a Creativity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06647) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-02 **Authors** Xuhui Jiang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are always seen as limitations. However, could they also be a source of creativity? This survey explores this possibility, suggesting that hallucinations may contribute to LLM application by fostering creativity. This survey begins with a review of the taxonomy of hallucinations and their negative impact on LLM reliability in critical applications. Then, through historical examples and recent relevant theories, the survey explores the potential creative benefits of hallucinations in LLMs. To elucidate the value and evaluation criteria of this connection, we delve into the definitions and assessment methods of creativity. Following the framework of divergent and convergent thinking phases, the survey systematically reviews the literature on transforming and harnessing hallucinations for creativity in LLMs. Finally, the survey discusses future research directions, emphasizing the need to further explore and refine the application of hallucinations in creative processes within LLMs. <br /> <br />[Task Supportive and Personalized Human-Large Language Model Interaction: A User Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06170) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Ben Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language model (LLM) applications, such as ChatGPT, are a powerful tool for online information-seeking (IS) and problem-solving tasks. However, users still face challenges initializing and refining prompts, and their cognitive barriers and biased perceptions further impede task completion. These issues reflect broader challenges identified within the fields of IS and interactive information retrieval (IIR). To address these, our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human-ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT-like platform integrated with supportive functions, including perception articulation, prompt suggestion, and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations, reduce cognitive loads, better refine prompts, and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user-centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human-LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users. <br /> <br />[Similarity-based Neighbor Selection for Graph LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03720) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-06 **Authors** Rui Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges for direct processing by Language Learning Models (LLMs), yet their extensive commonsense knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities offer great promise for node classification in TAGs. Prior research in this field has grappled with issues such as over-squashing, heterophily, and ineffective graph information integration, further compounded by inconsistencies in dataset partitioning and underutilization of advanced LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Similarity-based Neighbor Selection (SNS). Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional GNN methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple prompt interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in LLM applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SNS. <br /> <br />[Mathemyths: Leveraging Large Language Models to Teach Mathematical Language through Child-AI Co-Creative Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01927) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-26 **Authors** Chao Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Mathematical language is a cornerstone of a child's mathematical development, and children can effectively acquire this language through storytelling with a knowledgeable and engaging partner. In this study, we leverage the recent advances in large language models to conduct free-form, creative conversations with children. Consequently, we developed Mathemyths, a joint storytelling agent that takes turns co-creating stories with children while integrating mathematical terms into the evolving narrative. This paper details our development process, illustrating how prompt-engineering can optimize LLMs for educational contexts. Through a user study involving 35 children aged 4-8 years, our results suggest that when children interacted with Mathemyths, their learning of mathematical language was comparable to those who co-created stories with a human partner. However, we observed differences in how children engaged with co-creation partners of different natures. Overall, we believe that LLM applications, like Mathemyths, offer children a unique conversational experience pertaining to focused learning objectives. <br /> <br />[Building Guardrails for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01822) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-02 **Authors** Yi Dong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to identify and mitigate their risks, especially when the risks can have profound impacts on human users and societies. Guardrails, which filter the inputs or outputs of LLMs, have emerged as a core safeguarding technology. This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions. Drawing on robust evidence from previous research, we advocate for a systematic approach to construct guardrails for LLMs, based on comprehensive consideration of diverse contexts across various LLMs applications. We propose employing socio-technical methods through collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team to pinpoint precise technical requirements, exploring advanced neural-symbolic implementations to embrace the complexity of the requirements, and developing verification and testing to ensure the utmost quality of the final product. <br /> <br />[Compensatory Biases Under Cognitive Load: Reducing Selection Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01740) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-04 **Authors** J. E. Eicher et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) like gpt-3.5-turbo and claude-instant-1.2 have become instrumental in interpreting and executing semantic-based tasks. Unfortunately, these models' inherent biases, akin to human cognitive biases, adversely affect their performance. Particularly affected is object selection from lists; a fundamental operation in digital navigation and decision-making. This research critically examines these biases and quantifies the effects on a representative list selection task. To explore these biases, we conducted a series of controlled experiments, manipulating temperature, list length, object identity, object type, prompt complexity, and model. This enabled us to isolate and measure the influence of the biases on selection behavior. Our findings show that bias structure is strongly dependent on the model, with object type modulating the magnitude of the effect. With a strong primacy effect, causing the first objects in a list to be disproportionately represented in outputs. Furthermore the usage of guard rails, a prompt engineering method of ensuring a response structure, can increase bias and decrease instruction adherence when combined with a selection task. The bias is ablated when the guard rail step is separated from the list sampling step, lowering the complexity of each individual task. The implications of this research are two-fold, practically providing a guide for designing unbiased LLM applications and theoretically suggesting that LLMs experience a form of cognitive load compensated for by increasing bias. <br /> <br />[APT-Pipe: A Prompt-Tuning Tool for Social Data Annotation using ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01697) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Yiming Zhu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent research has highlighted the potential of LLM applications, like ChatGPT, for performing label annotation on social computing text. However, it is already well known that performance hinges on the quality of the input prompts. To address this, there has been a flurry of research into prompt tuning -- techniques and guidelines that attempt to improve the quality of prompts. Yet these largely rely on manual effort and prior knowledge of the dataset being annotated. To address this limitation, we propose APT-Pipe, an automated prompt-tuning pipeline. APT-Pipe aims to automatically tune prompts to enhance ChatGPT's text classification performance on any given dataset. We implement APT-Pipe and test it across twelve distinct text classification datasets. We find that prompts tuned by APT-Pipe help ChatGPT achieve higher weighted F1-score on nine out of twelve experimented datasets, with an improvement of 7.01% on average. We further highlight APT-Pipe's flexibility as a framework by showing how it can be extended to support additional tuning mechanisms. <br /> <br />[DrugAssist: A Large Language Model for Molecule Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10334) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-28 **Authors** Geyan Ye et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recently, the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks has attracted an increasing number of attempts to apply LLMs in drug discovery. However, molecule optimization, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, is currently an area that has seen little involvement from LLMs. Most of existing approaches focus solely on capturing the underlying patterns in chemical structures provided by the data, without taking advantage of expert feedback. These non-interactive approaches overlook the fact that the drug discovery process is actually one that requires the integration of expert experience and iterative refinement. To address this gap, we propose DrugAssist, an interactive molecule optimization model which performs optimization through human-machine dialogue by leveraging LLM's strong interactivity and generalizability. DrugAssist has achieved leading results in both single and multiple property optimization, simultaneously showcasing immense potential in transferability and iterative optimization. In addition, we publicly release a large instruction-based dataset called MolOpt-Instructions for fine-tuning language models on molecule optimization tasks. We have made our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/blazerye/DrugAssist, which we hope to pave the way for future research in LLMs' application for drug discovery. <br /> <br />[DistServe: Disaggregating Prefill and Decoding for Goodput-optimized Large Language Model Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09670) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-19 **Authors** Yinmin Zhong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> DistServe improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) serving by disaggregating the prefill and decoding computation. Existing LLM serving systems colocate the two phases and batch the computation of prefill and decoding across all users and requests. We find that this strategy not only leads to strong prefill-decoding interferences but also couples the resource allocation and parallelism plans for both phases. LLM applications often emphasize individual latency for each phase: time to first token (TTFT) for the prefill phase and time per output token (TPOT) of each request for the decoding phase. In the presence of stringent latency requirements, existing systems have to prioritize one latency over the other, or over-provision compute resources to meet both.   DistServe assigns prefill and decoding computation to different GPUs, hence eliminating prefill-decoding interferences. Given the application's TTFT and TPOT requirements, DistServe co-optimizes the resource allocation and parallelism strategy tailored for each phase. DistServe also places the two phases according to the serving cluster's bandwidth to minimize the communication caused by disaggregation. As a result, DistServe significantly improves LLM serving performance in terms of the maximum rate that can be served within both TTFT and TPOT constraints on each GPU. Our evaluations show that on various popular LLMs, applications, and latency requirements, DistServe can serve 4.48x more requests or 10.2x tighter SLO, compared to state-of-the-art systems, while staying within latency constraints for > 90% of requests. <br /> <br />[Graph database while computationally efficient filters out quickly the ESG integrated equities in investment management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07483) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-15 **Authors** Partha Sen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Design/methodology/approach This research evaluated the databases of SQL, No-SQL and graph databases to compare and contrast efficiency and performance.

Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at~\url{https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS}. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Social Networks: Applications, Challenges, and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02575) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-04 **Authors** Jingying Zeng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the way people generate, explore, and engage with content. We study how we can develop LLM applications for online social networks. Despite LLMs' successes in other domains, it is challenging to develop LLM-based products for social networks for numerous reasons, and it has been relatively under-reported in the research community. We categorize LLM applications for social networks into three categories. First is knowledge tasks where users want to find new knowledge and information, such as search and question-answering. Second is entertainment tasks where users want to consume interesting content, such as getting entertaining notification content. Third is foundational tasks that need to be done to moderate and operate the social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring. For each task, we share the challenges we found, solutions we developed, and lessons we learned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive paper about developing LLM applications for social networks. <br /> <br />[RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-31 **Authors** Yuanhao Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual cases and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. Furthermore, we show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive level of performance in hallucination detection when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models such as GPT-4. <br /> <br />[ComplexityNet: Increasing LLM Inference Efficiency by Learning Task Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11511) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-30 **Authors** Henry Bae et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We present ComplexityNet, a streamlined language model designed for assessing task complexity. This model predicts the likelihood of accurate output by various language models, each with different capabilities. Our initial application of ComplexityNet involves the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) dataset. We pioneered the creation of the first set of labels to define task complexity. ComplexityNet achieved a notable 79% accuracy in determining task complexity, a significant improvement over the 34% accuracy of the original, non fine-tuned model. Furthermore, ComplexityNet effectively reduces computational resource usage by 90% compared to using the highest complexity model, while maintaining a high code generation accuracy of 86.7%. This study demonstrates that fine-tuning smaller models to categorize tasks based on their complexity can lead to a more balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the use of Large Language Models. Our findings suggest a promising direction for optimizing LLM applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. <br /> <br />[RJUA-QA: A Comprehensive QA Dataset for Urology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09785) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-07 **Authors** Shiwei Lyu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We introduce RJUA-QA, a novel medical dataset for question answering (QA) and reasoning with clinical evidence, contributing to bridge the gap between general large language models (LLMs) and medical-specific LLM applications. RJUA-QA is derived from realistic clinical scenarios and aims to facilitate LLMs in generating reliable diagnostic and advice. The dataset contains 2,132 curated Question-Context-Answer pairs, corresponding about 25,000 diagnostic records and clinical cases. The dataset covers 67 common urological disease categories, where the disease coverage exceeds 97.6\% of the population seeking medical services in urology. Each data instance in RJUA-QA comprises: (1) a question mirroring real patient to inquiry about clinical symptoms and medical conditions, (2) a context including comprehensive expert knowledge, serving as a reference for medical examination and diagnosis, (3) a doctor response offering the diagnostic conclusion and suggested examination guidance, (4) a diagnosed clinical disease as the recommended diagnostic outcome, and (5) clinical advice providing recommendations for medical examination. RJUA-QA is the first medical QA dataset for clinical reasoning over the patient inquiries, where expert-level knowledge and experience are required for yielding diagnostic conclusions and medical examination advice. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted to evaluate the performance of both medical-specific and general LLMs on the RJUA-QA dataset. Our data is are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/alipay/RJU_Ant_QA}. <br /> <br />[ChatSOS: LLM-based knowledge Q&A system for safety engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08629) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-14 **Authors** Haiyang Tang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have notably propelled natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, demonstrating significant potential in safety engineering applications. Despite these advancements, LLMs face constraints in processing specialized tasks, attributed to factors such as corpus size, input processing limitations, and privacy concerns. Obtaining useful information from reliable sources in a limited time is crucial for LLM. Addressing this, our study introduces an LLM-based Q&A system for safety engineering, enhancing the comprehension and response accuracy of the model. We employed prompt engineering to incorporate external knowledge databases, thus enriching the LLM with up-to-date and reliable information. The system analyzes historical incident reports through statistical methods, utilizes vector embedding to construct a vector database, and offers an efficient similarity-based search functionality. Our findings indicate that the integration of external knowledge significantly augments the capabilities of LLM for in-depth problem analysis and autonomous task assignment. It effectively summarizes accident reports and provides pertinent recommendations. This integration approach not only expands LLM applications in safety engineering but also sets a precedent for future developments towards automation and intelligent systems. <br /> <br />[METAL: Metamorphic Testing Framework for Analyzing Large-Language Model Qualities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06056) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-11 **Authors** Sangwon Hyun et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large-Language Models (LLMs) have shifted the paradigm of natural language data processing. However, their black-boxed and probabilistic characteristics can lead to potential risks in the quality of outputs in diverse LLM applications. Recent studies have tested Quality Attributes (QAs), such as robustness or fairness, of LLMs by generating adversarial input texts. However, existing studies have limited their coverage of QAs and tasks in LLMs and are difficult to extend. Additionally, these studies have only used one evaluation metric, Attack Success Rate (ASR), to assess the effectiveness of their approaches. We propose a MEtamorphic Testing for Analyzing LLMs (METAL) framework to address these issues by applying Metamorphic Testing (MT) techniques. This approach facilitates the systematic testing of LLM qualities by defining Metamorphic Relations (MRs), which serve as modularized evaluation metrics. The METAL framework can automatically generate hundreds of MRs from templates that cover various QAs and tasks. In addition, we introduced novel metrics that integrate the ASR method into the semantic qualities of text to assess the effectiveness of MRs accurately. Through the experiments conducted with three prominent LLMs, we have confirmed that the METAL framework effectively evaluates essential QAs on primary LLM tasks and reveals the quality risks in LLMs. Moreover, the newly proposed metrics can guide the optimal MRs for testing each task and suggest the most effective method for generating MRs. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Privacy: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02003) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Yifan Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into "The Good" (beneficial LLM applications), "The Bad" (offensive applications), and "The Ugly" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Networking: Applications, Enabling Techniques, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17474) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-29 **Authors** Yudong Huang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid evolution of network technologies and the growing complexity of network tasks necessitate a paradigm shift in how networks are designed, configured, and managed. With a wealth of knowledge and expertise, large language models (LLMs) are one of the most promising candidates. This paper aims to pave the way for constructing domain-adapted LLMs for networking. Firstly, we present potential LLM applications for vertical network fields and showcase the mapping from natural language to network language. Then, several enabling technologies are investigated, including parameter-efficient finetuning and prompt engineering. The insight is that language understanding and tool usage are both required for network LLMs. Driven by the idea of embodied intelligence, we propose the ChatNet, a domain-adapted network LLM framework with access to various external network tools. ChatNet can reduce the time required for burdensome network planning tasks significantly, leading to a substantial improvement in efficiency. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are highlighted. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models Suffer From Their Own Output: An Analysis of the Self-Consuming Training Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16822) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-28 **Authors** Martin Briesch et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLM) have become state of the art in many benchmarks and conversational LLM applications like ChatGPT are now widely used by the public. Those LLMs can be used to generate large amounts of content which is posted on the internet to various platforms. As LLMs are trained on datasets usually collected from the internet, this LLM-generated content might be used to train the next generation of LLMs. Therefore, a self-consuming training loop emerges in which new LLM generations are trained on the output from the previous generations. We empirically study this self-consuming training loop using a novel dataset to analytically and accurately measure quality and diversity of generated outputs. We find that this self-consuming training loop initially improves both quality and diversity. However, after a few generations the output inevitably degenerates in diversity. We find that the rate of degeneration depends on the proportion of real and generated data. <br /> <br />[A Security Risk Taxonomy for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11415) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-19 **Authors** Erik Derner et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) permeate more and more applications, an assessment of their associated security risks becomes increasingly necessary. The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a gap in current research by focusing on the security risks posed by LLMs, which extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication pipeline, explicitly focusing on prompt-based attacks on LLMs. We categorize the attacks by target and attack type within a prompt-based interaction scheme. The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and trustworthiness. <br /> <br />[The Ups and Downs of Large Language Model Inference with Vocabulary Trimming by Language Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09709) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-28 **Authors** Nikolay Bogoychev et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Deploying large language models (LLMs) encounters challenges due to intensive computational and memory requirements. Our research examines vocabulary trimming (VT) inspired by restricting embedding entries to the language of interest to bolster time and memory efficiency. While such modifications have been proven effective in tasks like machine translation, tailoring them to LLMs demands specific modifications given the diverse nature of LLM applications. We apply two language heuristics to trim the full vocabulary - Unicode-based script filtering and corpus-based selection - to different LLM families and sizes. The methods are straightforward, interpretable, and easy to implement. It is found that VT reduces the memory usage of small models by nearly 50% and has an upper bound of 25% improvement in generation speed. Yet, we reveal the limitations of these methods in that they do not perform consistently well for each language with diminishing returns in larger models. <br /> <br />[How Well Do Large Language Models Truly Ground?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09069) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-15 **Authors** Hyunji Lee et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Reliance on the inherent knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) can cause issues such as hallucinations, lack of control, and difficulties in integrating variable knowledge. To mitigate this, LLMs can be probed to generate responses by grounding on external context, often given as input (knowledge-augmented models). Yet, previous research is often confined to a narrow view of the term "grounding", often only focusing on whether the response contains the correct answer or not, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To address this limitation, we introduce a strict definition of grounding: a model is considered truly grounded when its responses (1) fully utilize necessary knowledge from the provided context, and (2) don't exceed the knowledge within the contexts. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to assess this new definition and perform experiments across 13 LLMs of different sizes and training methods to provide insights into the factors that influence grounding performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more reliable and controllable LLM applications. <br /> <br />[A Robust Semantics-based Watermark for Large Language Model against Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08721) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-01 **Authors** Jie Ren et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have show great ability in various natural language tasks. However, there are concerns that LLMs are possible to be used improperly or even illegally. To prevent the malicious usage of LLMs, detecting LLM-generated text becomes crucial in the deployment of LLM applications. Watermarking is an effective strategy to detect the LLM-generated content by encoding a pre-defined secret watermark to facilitate the detection process. However, the majority of existing watermark methods leverage the simple hashes of precedent tokens to partition vocabulary. Such watermark can be easily eliminated by paraphrase and correspondingly the detection effectiveness will be greatly compromised. Thus, to enhance the robustness against paraphrase, we propose a semantics-based watermark framework SemaMark. It leverages the semantics as an alternative to simple hashes of tokens since the paraphrase will likely preserve the semantic meaning of the sentences. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SemaMark under different paraphrases. <br /> <br />[Evaluating LLMs on Document-Based QA: Exact Answer Selection and Numerical Extraction using Cogtale dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07878) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-03 **Authors** Zafaryab Rasool et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Document-based Question-Answering (QA) tasks are crucial for precise information retrieval. While some existing work focus on evaluating large language models performance on retrieving and answering questions from documents, assessing the LLMs performance on QA types that require exact answer selection from predefined options and numerical extraction is yet to be fully assessed. In this paper, we specifically focus on this underexplored context and conduct empirical analysis of LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) on question types, including single-choice, yes-no, multiple-choice, and number extraction questions from documents in zero-shot setting. We use the CogTale dataset for evaluation, which provide human expert-tagged responses, offering a robust benchmark for precision and factual grounding. We found that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can precisely answer many single-choice and yes-no questions given relevant context, demonstrating their efficacy in information retrieval tasks. However, their performance diminishes when confronted with multiple-choice and number extraction formats, lowering the overall performance of the model on this task, indicating that these models may not yet be sufficiently reliable for the task. This limits the applications of LLMs on applications demanding precise information extraction from documents, such as meta-analysis tasks. These findings hinge on the assumption that the retrievers furnish pertinent context necessary for accurate responses, emphasizing the need for further research. Our work offers a framework for ongoing dataset evaluation, ensuring that LLM applications for information retrieval and document analysis continue to meet evolving standards. <br /> <br />[Knowledgeable Preference Alignment for LLMs in Domain-specific Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06503) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-18 **Authors** Yichi Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Deploying large language models (LLMs) to real scenarios for domain-specific question answering (QA) is a key thrust for LLM applications, which poses numerous challenges, especially in ensuring that responses are both accommodating to user requirements and appropriately leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. They are the two major difficulties for LLM application as vanilla fine-tuning falls short of addressing. Combining these requirements, we conceive of them as the requirement for the model's preference to be harmoniously aligned with humans'. Thus, we introduce Knowledgeable Preference AlignmenT (KnowPAT), which constructs two kinds of preference sets to tackle the two issues. Besides, we design a new alignment objective to align the LLM preference with different human preferences uniformly, aiming to optimize LLM performance in real-world, domain-specific QA settings. Adequate experiments and comprehensive comparisons with 15 baseline methods illustrate that our KnowPAT is a superior pipeline for real-scenario domain-specific QA with LLMs. <br /> <br />[ChipNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-04 **Authors** Mingjie Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, we instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: domain-adaptive tokenization, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, model alignment with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models. We evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Our evaluations demonstrate that domain-adaptive pretraining of language models, can lead to superior performance in domain related downstream tasks compared to their base LLaMA2 counterparts, without degradations in generic capabilities. In particular, our largest model, ChipNeMo-70B, outperforms the highly capable GPT-4 on two of our use cases, namely engineering assistant chatbot and EDA scripts generation, while exhibiting competitive performance on bug summarization and analysis. These results underscore the potential of domain-specific customization for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in specialized applications. <br /> <br />[RCAgent: Cloud Root Cause Analysis by Autonomous Agents with Tool-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16340) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-25 **Authors** Zefan Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language model (LLM) applications in cloud root cause analysis (RCA) have been actively explored recently. However, current methods are still reliant on manual workflow settings and do not unleash LLMs' decision-making and environment interaction capabilities. We present RCAgent, a tool-augmented LLM autonomous agent framework for practical and privacy-aware industrial RCA usage. Running on an internally deployed model rather than GPT families, RCAgent is capable of free-form data collection and comprehensive analysis with tools. Our framework combines a variety of enhancements, including a unique Self-Consistency for action trajectories, and a suite of methods for context management, stabilization, and importing domain knowledge. Our experiments show RCAgent's evident and consistent superiority over ReAct across all aspects of RCA -- predicting root causes, solutions, evidence, and responsibilities -- and tasks covered or uncovered by current rules, as validated by both automated metrics and human evaluations. Furthermore, RCAgent has already been integrated into the diagnosis and issue discovery workflow of the Real-time Compute Platform for Apache Flink of Alibaba Cloud. <br /> <br />[PoisonPrompt: Backdoor Attack on Prompt-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12439) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-18 **Authors** Hongwei Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompts have significantly improved the performance of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) on various downstream tasks recently, making them increasingly indispensable for a diverse range of LLM application scenarios. However, the backdoor vulnerability, a serious security threat that can maliciously alter the victim model's normal predictions, has not been sufficiently explored for prompt-based LLMs. In this paper, we present POISONPROMPT, a novel backdoor attack capable of successfully compromising both hard and soft prompt-based LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness, fidelity, and robustness of POISONPROMPT through extensive experiments on three popular prompt methods, using six datasets and three widely used LLMs. Our findings highlight the potential security threats posed by backdoor attacks on prompt-based LLMs and emphasize the need for further research in this area. <br /> <br />[NeMo Guardrails: A Toolkit for Controllable and Safe LLM Applications with Programmable Rails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-16 **Authors** Traian Rebedea et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems. Guardrails (or rails for short) are a specific way of controlling the output of an LLM, such as not talking about topics considered harmful, following a predefined dialogue path, using a particular language style, and more. There are several mechanisms that allow LLM providers and developers to add guardrails that are embedded into a specific model at training, e.g. using model alignment. Differently, using a runtime inspired from dialogue management, NeMo Guardrails allows developers to add programmable rails to LLM applications - these are user-defined, independent of the underlying LLM, and interpretable. Our initial results show that the proposed approach can be used with several LLM providers to develop controllable and safe LLM applications using programmable rails. <br /> <br />[Chatmap : Large Language Model Interaction with Cartographic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01429) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-28 **Authors** Eren Unlu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The swift advancement and widespread availability of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), complemented by robust fine-tuning methodologies, have catalyzed their adaptation for innovative and industrious applications. Enabling LLMs to recognize and interpret geospatial data, while offering a linguistic access to vast cartographic datasets, is of significant importance. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most ambitious open-source global initiative offering detailed urban and rural geographic data, curated by a community of over 10 million contributors, which constitutes a great potential for LLM applications. In this study, we demonstrate the proof of concept and details of the process of fine-tuning a relatively small scale (1B parameters) LLM with a relatively small artificial dataset curated by a more capable teacher model, in order to provide a linguistic interface to the OSM data of an arbitrary urban region. Through this interface, users can inquire about a location's attributes, covering a wide spectrum of concepts, such as its touristic appeal or the potential profitability of various businesses in that vicinity. The study aims to provide an initial guideline for such generative artificial intelligence (AI) adaptations and demonstrate early signs of useful emerging abilities in this context even in minimal computational settings. The embeddings of artificially curated prompts including OSM data are also investigated in detail, which might be instrumental for potential geospatially aware urban Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. <br /> <br />[People's Perceptions Toward Bias and Related Concepts in Large Language Models: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14504) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-03 **Authors** Lu Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have brought breakthroughs in tasks including translation, summarization, information retrieval, and language generation, gaining growing interest in the CHI community. Meanwhile, the literature shows researchers' controversial perceptions about the efficacy, ethics, and intellectual abilities of LLMs. However, we do not know how people perceive LLMs that are pervasive in everyday tools, specifically regarding their experience with LLMs around bias, stereotypes, social norms, or safety. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to understand what empirical insights papers have gathered about people's perceptions toward LLMs. From a total of 231 retrieved papers, we full-text reviewed 15 papers that recruited human evaluators to assess their experiences with LLMs. We report different biases and related concepts investigated by these studies, four broader LLM application areas, the evaluators' perceptions toward LLMs' performances including advantages, biases, and conflicting perceptions, factors influencing these perceptions, and concerns about LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Machine-assisted mixed methods: augmenting humanities and social sciences with artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14379) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-24 **Authors** Andres Karjus et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and social sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks previously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution proposes a systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise, machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to transparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased as proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference and text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre composition in literature and film; social network inference, automated lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural analytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human) annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace, but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have arguably never been more critical. <br /> <br />[AnglE-optimized Text Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12871) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-08 **Authors** Xianming Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks. The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle optimization in STS. <br /> <br />[Hide and Seek (HaS): A Lightweight Framework for Prompt Privacy Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03057) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-06 **Authors** Yu Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Numerous companies have started offering services based on large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, which inevitably raises privacy concerns as users' prompts are exposed to the model provider. Previous research on secure reasoning using multi-party computation (MPC) has proven to be impractical for LLM applications due to its time-consuming and communication-intensive nature. While lightweight anonymization techniques can protect private information in prompts through substitution or masking, they fail to recover sensitive data replaced in the LLM-generated results. In this paper, we expand the application scenarios of anonymization techniques by training a small local model to de-anonymize the LLM's returned results with minimal computational overhead. We introduce the HaS framework, where "H(ide)" and "S(eek)" represent its two core processes: hiding private entities for anonymization and seeking private entities for de-anonymization, respectively. To quantitatively assess HaS's privacy protection performance, we propose both black-box and white-box adversarial models. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to evaluate HaS's usability in translation and classification tasks. The experimental findings demonstrate that the HaS framework achieves an optimal balance between privacy protection and utility. <br /> <br />[A Study on the Implementation of Generative AI Services Using an Enterprise Data-Based LLM Application Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01105) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-18 **Authors** Cheonsu Jeong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study presents a method for implementing generative AI services by utilizing the Large Language Models (LLM) application architecture.

This interplay of domain knowledge and AI holds significant promise in creating a more insightful diagnostic tool.   Additionally, our research explores the dynamics of zero-shot and few-shot prompt learning based on LLMs. By comparing the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT with traditional supervised ML models in different data conditions, we aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies under varied data availability. In essence, this paper bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, proposing a novel methodology for LLMs application in clinical decision support systems.

However, they have not yet been applied to Fault Localization (FL), in which one must find the code element responsible for a bug from a potentially vast codebase. Nonetheless, LLM application to FL has the potential to benefit developers both in terms of performance and explainability. In this work, we present AutoFL, an automated fault localization technique that only requires a single failing test, and in its fault localization process generates an explanation about why the given test fails. Using the function call API of the OpenAI LLM, ChatGPT, we provide tools that allow it to explore a large source code repository, which would otherwise pose a significant challenge as it would be impossible to fit all the source code within the limited prompt length. Our results indicate that, on the widely used Defects4J benchmark, AutoFL can identify the faulty method on the first try more often than all standalone techniques we compared against from prior work. Nonetheless, there is ample room to improve performance, and we encourage further experimentation of language model-based FL as a promising research area. <br /> <br />[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Representative Vector Summarization for large unstructured textual data in Medical Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00479) <br /> **Date** 2023-08-01 **Authors** S. S. Manathunga et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models are increasingly being used for various tasks including content generation and as chatbots. Despite their impressive performances in general tasks, LLMs need to be aligned when applying for domain specific tasks to mitigate the problems of hallucination and producing harmful answers. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows to easily attach and manipulate a non-parametric knowledgebases to LLMs. Applications of RAG in the field of medical education are discussed in this paper. A combined extractive and abstractive summarization method for large unstructured textual data using representative vectors is proposed. <br /> <br />[Towards Codable Watermarking for Injecting Multi-bits Information to LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15992) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-03 **Authors** Lean Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) generate texts with increasing fluency and realism, there is a growing need to identify the source of texts to prevent the abuse of LLMs. Text watermarking techniques have proven reliable in distinguishing whether a text is generated by LLMs by injecting hidden patterns. However, we argue that existing LLM watermarking methods are encoding-inefficient and cannot flexibly meet the diverse information encoding needs (such as encoding model version, generation time, user id, etc.). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the topic of Codable Text Watermarking for LLMs (CTWL) that allows text watermarks to carry multi-bit customizable information. First of all, we study the taxonomy of LLM watermarking technologies and give a mathematical formulation for CTWL. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation system for CTWL: (1) watermarking success rate, (2) robustness against various corruptions, (3) coding rate of payload information, (4) encoding and decoding efficiency, (5) impacts on the quality of the generated text. To meet the requirements of these non-Pareto-improving metrics, we follow the most prominent vocabulary partition-based watermarking direction, and devise an advanced CTWL method named Balance-Marking. The core idea of our method is to use a proxy language model to split the vocabulary into probability-balanced parts, thereby effectively maintaining the quality of the watermarked text. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/codable-watermarking-for-llm. <br /> <br />[Development of the ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence and Natural Large Language Models for Accountable Reporting and Use (CANGARU) Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08974) <br /> **Date** 2023-07-18 **Authors** Giovanni E. Cacciamani et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The swift progress and ubiquitous adoption of Generative AI (GAI), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have spurred queries about their ethical application, use, and disclosure in scholarly research and scientific productions. A few publishers and journals have recently created their own sets of rules; however, the absence of a unified approach may lead to a 'Babel Tower Effect,' potentially resulting in confusion rather than desired standardization. In response to this, we present the ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Large Language Models for Accountable Reporting and Use Guidelines (CANGARU) initiative, with the aim of fostering a cross-disciplinary global inclusive consensus on the ethical use, disclosure, and proper reporting of GAI/GPT/LLM technologies in academia. The present protocol consists of four distinct parts: a) an ongoing systematic review of GAI/GPT/LLM applications to understand the linked ideas, findings, and reporting standards in scholarly research, and to formulate guidelines for its use and disclosure, b) a bibliometric analysis of existing author guidelines in journals that mention GAI/GPT/LLM, with the goal of evaluating existing guidelines, analyzing the disparity in their recommendations, and identifying common rules that can be brought into the Delphi consensus process, c) a Delphi survey to establish agreement on the items for the guidelines, ensuring principled GAI/GPT/LLM use, disclosure, and reporting in academia, and d) the subsequent development and dissemination of the finalized guidelines and their supplementary explanation and elaboration documents. <br /> <br />[Concept-Oriented Deep Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17089) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-19 **Authors** Daniel T. Chang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successfully used in many natural-language tasks and applications including text generation and AI chatbots. They also are a promising new technology for concept-oriented deep learning (CODL). However, the prerequisite is that LLMs understand concepts and ensure conceptual consistency. We discuss these in this paper, as well as major uses of LLMs for CODL including concept extraction from text, concept graph extraction from text, and concept learning. Human knowledge consists of both symbolic (conceptual) knowledge and embodied (sensory) knowledge. Text-only LLMs, however, can represent only symbolic (conceptual) knowledge. Multimodal LLMs, on the other hand, are capable of representing the full range (conceptual and sensory) of human knowledge. We discuss conceptual understanding in visual-language LLMs, the most important multimodal LLMs, and major uses of them for CODL including concept extraction from image, concept graph extraction from image, and concept learning. While uses of LLMs for CODL are valuable standalone, they are particularly valuable as part of LLM applications such as AI chatbots. <br /> <br />[Empowering Molecule Discovery for Molecule-Caption Translation with Large Language Models: A ChatGPT Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06615) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-22 **Authors** Jiatong Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. However, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, or suffer from sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and in-context learning (ICL), which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. Despite several previous works trying to apply LLMs in this task, the lack of domain-specific corpus and difficulties in training specialized LLMs still remain challenges. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based framework (MolReGPT) for molecule-caption translation, where an In-Context Few-Shot Molecule Learning paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT to perform their in-context learning capability without domain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to enable LLMs to learn the task knowledge from context examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT on molecule-caption translation, including molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that compared to fine-tuned models, MolReGPT outperforms MolT5-base and is comparable to MolT5-large without additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs via in-context learning in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery. Our work expands the scope of LLM applications, as well as providing a new paradigm for molecule discovery and design. <br /> <br />[Protect Your Prompts: Protocols for IP Protection in LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06297) <br /> **Date** 2023-06-09 **Authors** M. A. van Wyk et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the rapid adoption of AI in the form of large language models (LLMs), the potential value of carefully engineered prompts has become significant. However, to realize this potential, prompts should be tradable on an open market. Since prompts are, at present, generally economically non-excludable, by virtue of their nature as text, no general competitive market has yet been established. This note discusses two protocols intended to provide protection of prompts, elevating their status as intellectual property, thus confirming the intellectual property rights of prompt engineers, and potentially supporting the flourishing of an open market for LLM prompts. <br /> <br />[On the Detectability of ChatGPT Content: Benchmarking, Methodology, and Evaluation through the Lens of Academic Writing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05524) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-18 **Authors** Zeyan Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With ChatGPT under the spotlight, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assist academic writing has drawn a significant amount of debate in the community. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive study of the detectability of ChatGPT-generated content within the academic literature, particularly focusing on the abstracts of scientific papers, to offer holistic support for the future development of LLM applications and policies in academia. Specifically, we first present GPABench2, a benchmarking dataset of over 2.8 million comparative samples of human-written, GPT-written, GPT-completed, and GPT-polished abstracts of scientific writing in computer science, physics, and humanities and social sciences. Second, we explore the methodology for detecting ChatGPT content. We start by examining the unsatisfactory performance of existing ChatGPT detecting tools and the challenges faced by human evaluators (including more than 240 researchers or students). We then test the hand-crafted linguistic features models as a baseline and develop a deep neural framework named CheckGPT to better capture the subtle and deep semantic and linguistic patterns in ChatGPT written literature. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed CheckGPT framework in each benchmarking task over different disciplines. To evaluate the detectability of ChatGPT content, we conduct extensive experiments on the transferability, prompt engineering, and robustness of CheckGPT. <br /> <br />[Allies: Prompting Large Language Model with Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14766) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-19 **Authors** Hao Sun et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the advance of large language models (LLMs), the research field of LLM applications becomes more and more popular and the idea of constructing pipelines to accomplish complex tasks by stacking LLM API calls come true. However, this kind of methods face two limitations: narrow information coverage and low fault tolerance. In this work, we propose a novel method called ALLIES. Given an input query, ALLIES leverages LLMs to iteratively generate new queries related to the original query, enabling an iterative reasoning process. By iteratively refining and expanding the scope of the original query, ALLIES captures and utilizes hidden knowledge that may not be directly obtainable through retrieval. We take zero-shot open-domain question answering (ODQA) as an application scene and evaluate ALLIES on the widely-used benchmarks, such as NQ, WebQ and TriviaQA. The experimental results demonstrate that ALLIES significantly outperforms other zero-shot baselines, indicating its effectiveness in tackling those challenges. Our code is available in https://github.com/microsoft/SimXNS/tree/main/ALLIES. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models Leverage External Knowledge to Extend Clinical Insight Beyond Language Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10163) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-30 **Authors** Jiageng Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> $\textbf{Objectives}$: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Med-PaLM have excelled in various medical question-answering tasks. However, these English-centric models encounter challenges in non-English clinical settings, primarily due to limited clinical knowledge in respective languages, a consequence of imbalanced training corpora. We systematically evaluate LLMs in the Chinese medical context and develop a novel in-context learning framework to enhance their performance.   $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: The latest China National Medical Licensing Examination (CNMLE-2022) served as the benchmark. We collected 53 medical books and 381,149 medical questions to construct the medical knowledge base and question bank. The proposed Knowledge and Few-shot Enhancement In-context Learning (KFE) framework leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to integrate diverse external clinical knowledge sources. We evaluated KFE with ChatGPT(GPT3.5), GPT4, Baichuan2(BC2)-7B, and BC2-13B in CNMLE-2022 and investigated the effectiveness of different pathways for incorporating LLMs with medical knowledge from 7 perspectives.   $\textbf{Results}$: Directly applying ChatGPT failed to qualify for the CNMLE-2022 at a score of 51. Cooperated with the KFE, the LLMs with varying sizes yielded consistent and significant improvements. The ChatGPT's performance surged to 70.04 and GPT-4 achieved the highest score of 82.59. This surpasses the qualification threshold (60) and exceeds the average human score of 68.70. It also enabled a smaller BC2-13B to pass the examination, showcasing the great potential in low-resource settings.   $\textbf{Conclusion}$ : By synergizing medical knowledge through in-context learning, LLM can extend clinical insight beyond language barriers, significantly reducing language-related disparities of LLM applications and ensuring global benefit in healthcare. <br /> <br />[Red teaming ChatGPT via Jailbreaking: Bias, Robustness, Reliability and Toxicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12867) <br /> **Date** 2023-05-29 **Authors** Terry Yue Zhuo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization software and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is little systematic examination and user study of the risks and harmful behaviors of current LLM usage. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method called ``red teaming'' on OpenAI's ChatGPT\footnote{In this paper, ChatGPT refers to the version released on Dec 15th.} to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \textit{Bias} 2) \textit{Reliability} 3) \textit{Robustness} 4) \textit{Toxicity}. In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We find that a significant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our findings on AI ethics and harmal behaviors of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design considerations for responsible LLMs. We believe that our findings may give light on future efforts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Petals: Collaborative Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01188) <br /> **Date** 2023-03-02 **Authors** Alexander Borzunov et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Many NLP tasks benefit from using large language models (LLMs) that often have more than 100 billion parameters. With the release of BLOOM-176B and OPT-175B, everyone can download pretrained models of this scale. Still, using these models requires high-end hardware unavailable to many researchers. In some cases, LLMs can be used more affordably via RAM offloading or hosted APIs. However, these techniques have innate limitations: offloading is too slow for interactive inference, while APIs are not flexible enough for research that requires access to weights, attention or logits. In this work, we propose Petals - a system for inference and fine-tuning of large models collaboratively by joining the resources of multiple parties. We demonstrate that this strategy outperforms offloading for very large models, running inference of BLOOM-176B on consumer GPUs with $\approx$ 1 step per second, which is enough for many interactive LLM applications. Unlike most inference APIs, Petals also natively exposes hidden states of served models, allowing to train and share custom model extensions based on efficient fine-tuning methods. <br /> <br />
## LLM survey

[Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-26 **Authors** Paul Röttger et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs. <br /> <br />[Understanding Survey Paper Taxonomy about Large Language Models via Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10409) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-16 **Authors** Jun Zhuang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As new research on Large Language Models (LLMs) continues, it is difficult to keep up with new research and models. To help researchers synthesize the new research many have written survey papers, but even those have become numerous. In this paper, we develop a method to automatically assign survey papers to a taxonomy. We collect the metadata of 144 LLM survey papers and explore three paradigms to classify papers within the taxonomy. Our work indicates that leveraging graph structure information on co-category graphs can significantly outperform the language models in two paradigms; pre-trained language models' fine-tuning and zero-shot/few-shot classifications using LLMs. We find that our model surpasses an average human recognition level and that fine-tuning LLMs using weak labels generated by a smaller model, such as the GCN in this study, can be more effective than using ground-truth labels, revealing the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the taxonomy classification task. <br /> <br />[Faster and Lighter LLMs: A Survey on Current Challenges and Way Forward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01799) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-24 **Authors** Arnav Chavan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Despite the impressive performance of LLMs, their widespread adoption faces challenges due to substantial computational and memory requirements during inference. Recent advancements in model compression and system-level optimization methods aim to enhance LLM inference. This survey offers an overview of these methods, emphasizing recent developments. Through experiments on LLaMA(/2)-7B, we evaluate various compression techniques, providing practical insights for efficient LLM deployment in a unified setting. The empirical analysis on LLaMA(/2)-7B highlights the effectiveness of these methods. Drawing from survey insights, we identify current limitations and discuss potential future directions to improve LLM inference efficiency. We release the codebase to reproduce the results presented in this paper at https://github.com/nyunAI/Faster-LLM-Survey <br /> <br />[Efficient Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03863) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-31 **Authors** Zhongwei Wan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in important tasks such as natural language understanding, language generation, and complex reasoning and have the potential to make a substantial impact on our society. Such capabilities, however, come with the considerable resources they demand, highlighting the strong need to develop effective techniques for addressing their efficiency challenges.In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs research. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric, data-centric, and framework-centric perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we compile the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-LLMs-Survey, and will actively maintain this repository and incorporate new research as it emerges. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of the research developments in efficient LLMs and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field. <br /> <br />
