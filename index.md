## LLM Security

[Mapping LLM Security Landscapes: A Comprehensive Stakeholder Risk Assessment Proposal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13309) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Rahul Pankajakshan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse sectors has marked a transformative era, showcasing remarkable capabilities in text generation and problem-solving tasks. However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities. Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences. Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology. To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems. We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors. Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix. We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users. The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies. Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security. <br /> <br />[Ensuring Safe and High-Quality Outputs: A Guideline Library Approach for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11838) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-23 **Authors** Yi Luo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but also present risks such as biased content generation and privacy issues. One of the current alignment techniques includes principle-driven integration, but it faces challenges arising from the imprecision of manually crafted rules and inadequate risk perception in models without safety training. To address these, we introduce Guide-Align, a two-stage approach. Initially, a safety-trained model identifies potential risks and formulates specific guidelines for various inputs, establishing a comprehensive library of guidelines and a model for input-guidelines retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval model correlates new inputs with relevant guidelines, which guide LLMs in response generation to ensure safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. An additional optional stage involves fine-tuning a model with well-aligned datasets generated through the process implemented in the second stage. Our method customizes guidelines to accommodate diverse inputs, thereby enhancing the fine-grainedness and comprehensiveness of the guideline library. Furthermore, it incorporates safety expertise from a safety-trained LLM through a lightweight retrieval model. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM security and quality. Notably, our fine-tuned model, Labrador, even at 13 billion parameters, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses GPT-4 in alignment capabilities. <br /> <br />[Tastle: Distract Large Language Models for Automatic Jailbreak Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08424) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-13 **Authors** Zeguan Xiao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in recent days. Extensive efforts have been made before the public release of LLMs to align their behaviors with human values. The primary goal of alignment is to ensure their helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness. However, even meticulously aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious manipulations such as jailbreaking, leading to unintended behaviors. The jailbreak is to intentionally develop a malicious prompt that escapes from the LLM security restrictions to produce uncensored detrimental contents. Previous works explore different jailbreak methods for red teaming LLMs, yet they encounter challenges regarding to effectiveness and scalability. In this work, we propose Tastle, a novel black-box jailbreak framework for automated red teaming of LLMs. We designed malicious content concealing and memory reframing with an iterative optimization algorithm to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research about the distractibility and over-confidence phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments of jailbreaking both open-source and proprietary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability and transferability. We also evaluate the effectiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods against our attack and highlight the crucial need to develop more effective and practical defense strategies. <br /> <br />[A New Era in LLM Security: Exploring Security Concerns in Real-World LLM-based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18649) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Fangzhou Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on. Along with the great potential, there are also increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent systems. However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on). In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the individual LLMs. To do so, we build on top of the information flow and formulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects. Based on this construction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints. To ground this new attack surface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4. Our investigation exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components. We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has designed numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these safety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers. To further demonstrate the real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an end-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat history, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct access to OpenAI GPT4. Our demo is in the link: https://fzwark.github.io/LLM-System-Attack-Demo/ <br /> <br />[Making Them Ask and Answer: Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Few Queries via Disguise and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18104) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Tong Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable success across various tasks, but the trustworthiness of LLMs is still an open problem. One specific threat is the potential to generate toxic or harmful responses. Attackers can craft adversarial prompts that induce harmful responses from LLMs. In this work, we pioneer a theoretical foundation in LLMs security by identifying bias vulnerabilities within the safety fine-tuning and design a black-box jailbreak method named DRA (Disguise and Reconstruction Attack), which conceals harmful instructions through disguise and prompts the model to reconstruct the original harmful instruction within its completion. We evaluate DRA across various open-source and close-source models, showcasing state-of-the-art jailbreak success rates and attack efficiency. Notably, DRA boasts a 90\% attack success rate on LLM chatbots GPT-4. <br /> <br />[Is the System Message Really Important to Jailbreaks in Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14857) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Xiaotian Zou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has rendered them indispensable in modern society. While security measures are typically in place to align LLMs with human values prior to release, recent studies have unveiled a concerning phenomenon named "jailbreak." This term refers to the unexpected and potentially harmful responses generated by LLMs when prompted with malicious questions. Existing research focuses on generating jailbreak prompts but our study aim to answer a different question: Is the system message really important to jailbreak in LLMs? To address this question, we conducted experiments in a stable GPT version gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to generated jailbreak prompts with varying system messages: short, long, and none. We discover that different system messages have distinct resistances to jailbreak by experiments. Additionally, we explore the transferability of jailbreak across LLMs. This finding underscores the significant impact system messages can have on mitigating LLMs jailbreak. To generate system messages that are more resistant to jailbreak prompts, we propose System Messages Evolutionary Algorithms (SMEA). Through SMEA, we can get robust system messages population that demonstrate up to 98.9% resistance against jailbreak prompts. Our research not only bolsters LLMs security but also raises the bar for jailbreak, fostering advancements in this field of study. <br /> <br />[LLM Jailbreak Attack versus Defense Techniques -- A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13457) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-21 **Authors** Zihao Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMS) have increasingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts. Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security. We believe these contributions will facilitate the exploration of security measures within this domain. <br /> <br />[StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Sizhe Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model to deviate from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate the prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/PromptInjectionDefense. <br /> <br />[Studious Bob Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Yichuan Mo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to certain prompts that can induce them to bypass built-in safety measures and provide dangerous or illegal content, a phenomenon known as jailbreak. To protect LLMs from producing harmful information, various defense strategies are proposed, with most focusing on content filtering or adversarial training of models. In this paper, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) to train a defense control mechanism, which is then embedded as a prefix to user prompts to implement our defense strategy. We design a training process similar to adversarial training to achieve our optimized goal, alternating between updating attack and defense controls. To our knowledge, we are the first to implement defense from the perspective of prompt tuning. Once employed, our method will hardly impact the operational efficiency of LLMs. Experiments show that our method is effective in both black-box and white-box settings, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0 while maintaining the benign answer rate of 80% to simple benign questions. Our work might potentially chart a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security. <br /> <br />[Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12192) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-16 **Authors** Yiyi Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Textual data is often represented as realnumbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be vulnerable to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages vulnerable to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, and thoroughly explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings. <br /> <br />
## LLM Application

[Designing Child-Centric AI Learning Environments: Insights from LLM-Enhanced Creative Project-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16159) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-24 **Authors** Siyu Zha et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Project-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that is very helpful in nurturing students' creativity, but it requires significant time and energy from both students and teachers. Large language models (LLMs) have been proven to assist in creative tasks, yet much controversy exists regarding their role in fostering creativity. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL settings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an exploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five design considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we developed an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional experiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can enhance every stage of PBL. Additionally, we also discovered ambivalent perspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we explored the challenge and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and reflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational practice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into harnessing AI's potential in child-centric educational settings. <br /> <br />[The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-26 **Authors** Hannah R. Lawrence et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Global rates of mental health concerns are rising and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental healthcare will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health-related tasks. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs application to mental health and encourage adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. Especially critical is ensuring that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, adhere to ethical standards, and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-24 **Authors** Zheyuan He et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in various domains involving blockchain security (BS). Several recent studies are exploring LLMs applied to BS. However, there remains a gap in our understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we conduct a literature review on LLM4BS.   As the first review of LLM's application on blockchain security, our study aims to comprehensively analyze existing research and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of scholarly works, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, identity verification, anomaly detection, vulnerable repair, and so on. Furthermore, we critically assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and adversarial attacks. Our review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks inherent in this convergence, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. <br /> <br />[Breaking the Language Barrier: Can Direct Inference Outperform Pre-Translation in Multilingual LLM Applications?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04792) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-04 **Authors** Yotam Intrator et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models hold significant promise in multilingual applications. However, inherent biases stemming from predominantly English-centric pre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to complexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for pre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have been established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a comprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse benchmarks, including open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar studies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in prior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2. Specifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108 languages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective multilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with pre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity. <br /> <br />[Do Large Language Model Understand Multi-Intent Spoken Language ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04481) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-08 **Authors** Shangjian Yin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study marks a significant advancement by harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU), proposing a unique methodology that capitalizes on the generative power of LLMs within an SLU context. Our innovative technique reconfigures entity slots specifically for LLM application in multi-intent SLU environments and introduces the concept of Sub-Intent Instruction (SII), enhancing the dissection and interpretation of intricate, multi-intent communication within varied domains. The resultant datasets, dubbed LM-MixATIS and LM-MixSNIPS, are crafted from pre-existing benchmarks. Our research illustrates that LLMs can match and potentially excel beyond the capabilities of current state-of-the-art multi-intent SLU models. It further explores LLM efficacy across various intent configurations and dataset proportions. Moreover, we introduce two pioneering metrics, Entity Slot Accuracy (ESA) and Combined Semantic Accuracy (CSA), to provide an in-depth analysis of LLM proficiency in this complex field. <br /> <br />[SciAssess: Benchmarking LLM Proficiency in Scientific Literature Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01976) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-15 **Authors** Hengxing Cai et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation, igniting a surge of interest in leveraging these technologies in the field of scientific literature analysis. Existing benchmarks, however, inadequately evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in scientific literature analysis, especially in scenarios involving complex comprehension and multimodal data. In response, we introduced SciAssess, a benchmark tailored for the in-depth analysis of scientific literature, crafted to provide a thorough assessment of LLMs' efficacy. SciAssess focuses on evaluating LLMs' abilities in memorization, comprehension, and analysis within the context of scientific literature analysis. It includes representative tasks from diverse scientific fields, such as general chemistry, organic materials, and alloy materials. And rigorous quality control measures ensure its reliability in terms of correctness, anonymization, and copyright compliance. SciAssess evaluates leading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Gemini, identifying their strengths and aspects for improvement and supporting the ongoing development of LLM applications in scientific literature analysis. SciAssess and its resources are made available at https://sci-assess.github.io, offering a valuable tool for advancing LLM capabilities in scientific literature analysis. <br /> <br />[Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01749) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-04 **Authors** Chulin Xie et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine learning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data generated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a promising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP finetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source LLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion models. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and generate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP finetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe. <br /> <br />[SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards Oracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-16 **Authors** Jiahuan Yan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive zero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch. Reversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its zero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative process. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly annotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold labels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model attains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical datasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the potential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training vertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations. <br /> <br />[AutoRD: An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontologies-enhanced Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00953) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-01 **Authors** Lang Cao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Objectives: Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates extracting information from clinical text about rare diseases. We have conducted various tests to evaluate the performance of AutoRD and highlighted its strengths and limitations in this paper.   Materials and Methods: Our system, AutoRD, is a software pipeline involving data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implement this using large language models and medical knowledge graphs developed from open-source medical ontologies. We quantitatively evaluate our system on entity extraction, relation extraction, and the performance of knowledge graph construction.   Results: AutoRD achieves an overall F1 score of 47.3%, a 14.4% improvement compared to the base LLM. In detail, AutoRD achieves an overall entity extraction F1 score of 56.1% (rare_disease: 83.5%, disease: 35.8%, symptom_and_sign: 46.1%, anaphor: 67.5%) and an overall relation extraction F1 score of 38.6% (produces: 34.7%, increases_risk_of: 12.4%, is_a: 37.4%, is_acronym: 44.1%, is_synonym: 16.3%, anaphora: 57.5%). Our qualitative experiment also demonstrates that the performance in constructing the knowledge graph is commendable.   Discussion: AutoRD demonstrates the potential of LLM applications in rare disease detection. This improvement is attributed to several design, including the integration of ontologies-enhanced LLMs.   Conclusion: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs. It uses ontologies-enhanced LLMs for a robust medical knowledge base. The superior performance of AutoRD is validated by experimental evaluations, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in healthcare. <br /> <br />[PRSA: Prompt Reverse Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-29 **Authors** Yong Yang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompt, recognized as crucial intellectual property, enables large language models (LLMs) to perform specific tasks without the need of fine-tuning, underscoring their escalating importance. With the rise of prompt-based services, such as prompt marketplaces and LLM applications, providers often display prompts' capabilities through input-output examples to attract users. However, this paradigm raises a pivotal security concern: does the exposure of input-output pairs pose the risk of potential prompt leakage, infringing on the intellectual property rights of the developers? To our knowledge, this problem still has not been comprehensively explored yet. To remedy this gap, in this paper, we perform the first in depth exploration and propose a novel attack framework for reverse-stealing prompts against commercial LLMs, namely PRSA. The main idea of PRSA is that by analyzing the critical features of the input-output pairs, we mimic and gradually infer (steal) the target prompts. In detail, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt pruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based on differential feedback to capture these critical features for effectively inferring the target prompts. In the prompt pruning phase, we identify and mask the words dependent on specific inputs, enabling the prompts to accommodate diverse inputs for generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we verify that PRSA poses a severe threat in real world scenarios. We have reported these findings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to take protective measures for prompt copyright. <br /> <br />
