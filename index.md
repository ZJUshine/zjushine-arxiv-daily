## LLM Security and Privacy

[Systematically Analyzing Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities in Diverse LLM Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23308) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-28 **Authors** Victoria Benjamin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study systematically analyzes the vulnerability of 36 large language models (LLMs) to various prompt injection attacks, a technique that leverages carefully crafted prompts to elicit malicious LLM behavior. Across 144 prompt injection tests, we observed a strong correlation between model parameters and vulnerability, with statistical analyses, such as logistic regression and random forest feature analysis, indicating that parameter size and architecture significantly influence susceptibility. Results revealed that 56 percent of tests led to successful prompt injections, emphasizing widespread vulnerability across various parameter sizes, with clustering analysis identifying distinct vulnerability profiles associated with specific model configurations. Additionally, our analysis uncovered correlations between certain prompt injection techniques, suggesting potential overlaps in vulnerabilities. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multi-layered defenses in LLMs deployed across critical infrastructure and sensitive industries. Successful prompt injection attacks could result in severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or misinformation. Future research should explore multilingual and multi-step defenses alongside adaptive mitigation strategies to strengthen LLM security in diverse, real-world environments. <br /> <br />[DEAN: Deactivating the Coupled Neurons to Mitigate Fairness-Privacy Conflicts in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16672) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-22 **Authors** Chen Qian et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{DEA}ctivate the fairness and privacy coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{DEAN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DEAN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, DEAN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChnQ/DEAN}. <br /> <br />[Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-20 **Authors** Benji Peng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment. <br /> <br />[From Solitary Directives to Interactive Encouragement! LLM Secure Code Generation by Natural Language Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14321) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-18 **Authors** Shigang Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in code generation, making them increasingly important in the field. However, the security issues of generated code have not been fully addressed, and the usability of LLMs in code generation still requires further exploration.   This work introduces SecCode, a framework that leverages an innovative interactive encouragement prompting (EP) technique for secure code generation with \textit{only NL} prompts. This approach ensures that the prompts can be easily shared and understood by general users. SecCode functions through three stages: 1) Code Generation using NL Prompts; 2) Code Vulnerability Detection and Fixing, utilising our proposed encouragement prompting; 3) Vulnerability Cross-Checking and Code Security Refinement. These stages are executed in multiple interactive iterations to progressively enhance security. By using both proprietary LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) and open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite Instruct) evaluated on three benchmark datasets, extensive experimental results show that our proposed SecCode greatly outperforms compared baselines, generating secure code with a high vulnerability correction rate. For example, SecCode exhibits a high fix success rate of over 76\% after running 5 automated EP interactive iterations and over 89\% after running 10 automated EP interactive iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to formulate secure code generation with NL prompts only. We have open-sourced our code and encourage the community to focus on secure code generation. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models are Easily Confused: A Quantitative Metric, Security Implications and Typological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13237) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-17 **Authors** Yiyi Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Language Confusion is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text that is neither in the desired language, nor in a contextually appropriate language. This phenomenon presents a critical challenge in text generation by LLMs, often appearing as erratic and unpredictable behavior. We hypothesize that there are linguistic regularities to this inherent vulnerability in LLMs and shed light on patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We introduce a novel metric, Language Confusion Entropy, designed to directly measure and quantify this confusion, based on language distributions informed by linguistic typology and lexical variation. Comprehensive comparisons with the Language Confusion Benchmark (Marchisio et al., 2024) confirm the effectiveness of our metric, revealing patterns of language confusion across LLMs. We further link language confusion to LLM security, and find patterns in the case of multilingual embedding inversion attacks. Our analysis demonstrates that linguistic typology offers theoretically grounded interpretation, and valuable insights into leveraging language similarities as a prior for LLM alignment and security. <br /> <br />[Aligning LLMs to Be Robust Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05451) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-07 **Authors** Sizhe Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software systems, interfacing between the user and the internet to assist with tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be carefully crafted and injected into external data sources to override the user's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction. Prompt injection attacks constitute a major threat to LLM security, making the design and implementation of practical countermeasures of paramount importance. To this end, we show that alignment can be a powerful tool to make LLMs more robust against prompt injection. Our method -- SecAlign -- first builds an alignment dataset by simulating prompt injection attacks and constructing pairs of desirable and undesirable responses. Then, we apply existing alignment techniques to fine-tune the LLM to be robust against these simulated attacks. Our experiments show that SecAlign robustifies the LLM substantially with a negligible hurt on model utility. Moreover, SecAlign's protection generalizes to strong attacks unseen in training. Specifically, the success rate of state-of-the-art GCG-based prompt injections drops from 56% to 2% in Mistral-7B after our alignment process. Our code is released at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SecAlign <br /> <br />[Towards Secure Tuning: Mitigating Security Risks Arising from Benign Instruction Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04524) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-06 **Authors** Yanrui Du et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has become an essential method for adapting base Large Language Models (LLMs) into variants for professional and private use. However, researchers have raised concerns over a significant decrease in LLMs' security following IFT, even when the IFT process involves entirely benign instructions (termed Benign IFT). Our study represents a pioneering effort to mitigate the security risks arising from Benign IFT. Specifically, we conduct a Module Robustness Analysis, aiming to investigate how LLMs' internal modules contribute to their security. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel IFT strategy, called the Modular Layer-wise Learning Rate (ML-LR) strategy. In our analysis, we implement a simple security feature classifier that serves as a proxy to measure the robustness of modules (e.g. $Q$/$K$/$V$, etc.). Our findings reveal that the module robustness shows clear patterns, varying regularly with the module type and the layer depth. Leveraging these insights, we develop a proxy-guided search algorithm to identify a robust subset of modules, termed Mods$_{Robust}$. During IFT, the ML-LR strategy employs differentiated learning rates for Mods$_{Robust}$ and the rest modules. Our experimental results show that in security assessments, the application of our ML-LR strategy significantly mitigates the rise in harmfulness of LLMs following Benign IFT. Notably, our ML-LR strategy has little impact on the usability or expertise of LLMs following Benign IFT. Furthermore, we have conducted comprehensive analyses to verify the soundness and flexibility of our ML-LR strategy. <br /> <br />[MoJE: Mixture of Jailbreak Experts, Naive Tabular Classifiers as Guard for Prompt Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17699) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-04 **Authors** Giandomenico Cornacchia et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications underscores the pressing need for robust security measures to thwart potential jailbreak attacks. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities within LLMs, endanger data integrity and user privacy. Guardrails serve as crucial protective mechanisms against such threats, but existing models often fall short in terms of both detection accuracy, and computational efficiency. This paper advocates for the significance of jailbreak attack prevention on LLMs, and emphasises the role of input guardrails in safeguarding these models. We introduce MoJE (Mixture of Jailbreak Expert), a novel guardrail architecture designed to surpass current limitations in existing state-of-the-art guardrails. By employing simple linguistic statistical techniques, MoJE excels in detecting jailbreak attacks while maintaining minimal computational overhead during model inference. Through rigorous experimentation, MoJE demonstrates superior performance capable of detecting 90% of the attacks without compromising benign prompts, enhancing LLMs security against jailbreak attacks. <br /> <br />[PathSeeker: Exploring LLM Security Vulnerabilities with a Reinforcement Learning-Based Jailbreak Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14177) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-03 **Authors** Zhihao Lin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use, raising concerns about their security. Traditional jailbreak attacks, which often rely on the model internal information or have limitations when exploring the unsafe behavior of the victim model, limiting their reducing their general applicability. In this paper, we introduce PathSeeker, a novel black-box jailbreak method, which is inspired by the game of rats escaping a maze. We think that each LLM has its unique "security maze", and attackers attempt to find the exit learning from the received feedback and their accumulated experience to compromise the target LLM's security defences. Our approach leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning, where smaller models collaborate to guide the main LLM in performing mutation operations to achieve the attack objectives. By progressively modifying inputs based on the model's feedback, our system induces richer, harmful responses. During our manual attempts to perform jailbreak attacks, we found that the vocabulary of the response of the target model gradually became richer and eventually produced harmful responses. Based on the observation, we also introduce a reward mechanism that exploits the expansion of vocabulary richness in LLM responses to weaken security constraints. Our method outperforms five state-of-the-art attack techniques when tested across 13 commercial and open-source LLMs, achieving high attack success rates, especially in strongly aligned commercial models like GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5, and GLM-4-air with strong safety alignment. This study aims to improve the understanding of LLM security vulnerabilities and we hope that this sturdy can contribute to the development of more robust defenses. <br /> <br />[Extracting Memorized Training Data via Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12367) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-01 **Authors** Ellen Su et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use. <br /> <br />[Securing Large Language Models: Addressing Bias, Misinformation, and Prompt Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08087) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-19 **Authors** Benji Peng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across various fields, yet their increasing use raises critical security concerns. This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field. <br /> <br />[Recent Advances in Attack and Defense Approaches of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03274) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-06 **Authors** Jing Cui et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and machine learning through their advanced text processing and generating capabilities. However, their widespread deployment has raised significant safety and reliability concerns. Established vulnerabilities in deep neural networks, coupled with emerging threat models, may compromise security evaluations and create a false sense of security. Given the extensive research in the field of LLM security, we believe that summarizing the current state of affairs will help the research community better understand the present landscape and inform future developments. This paper reviews current research on LLM vulnerabilities and threats, and evaluates the effectiveness of contemporary defense mechanisms. We analyze recent studies on attack vectors and model weaknesses, providing insights into attack mechanisms and the evolving threat landscape. We also examine current defense strategies, highlighting their strengths and limitations. By contrasting advancements in attack and defense methodologies, we identify research gaps and propose future directions to enhance LLM security. Our goal is to advance the understanding of LLM safety challenges and guide the development of more robust security measures. <br /> <br />[Safety Layers in Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-11 **Authors** Shen Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Aligned LLMs are secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining such security is not well understood yet, further these models can be vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers". We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on these findings, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly preserve LLM security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning. <br /> <br />[Investigating Coverage Criteria in Large Language Models: An In-Depth Study Through Jailbreak Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15207) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-27 **Authors** Shide Zhou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The swift advancement of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly shaped the landscape of artificial intelligence; however, their deployment in sensitive domains raises grave concerns, particularly due to their susceptibility to malicious exploitation. This situation underscores the insufficiencies in pre-deployment testing, highlighting the urgent need for more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation methods. This study presents a comprehensive empirical analysis assessing the efficacy of conventional coverage criteria in identifying these vulnerabilities, with a particular emphasis on the pressing issue of jailbreak attacks. Our investigation begins with a clustering analysis of the hidden states in LLMs, demonstrating that intrinsic characteristics of these states can distinctly differentiate between various types of queries. Subsequently, we assess the performance of these criteria across three critical dimensions: criterion level, layer level, and token level. Our findings uncover significant disparities in neuron activation patterns between the processing of normal and jailbreak queries, thereby corroborating the clustering results. Leveraging these findings, we propose an innovative approach for the real-time detection of jailbreak attacks by utilizing neural activation features. Our classifier demonstrates remarkable accuracy, averaging 96.33% in identifying jailbreak queries, including those that could lead to adversarial attacks. The importance of our research lies in its comprehensive approach to addressing the intricate challenges of LLM security. By enabling instantaneous detection from the model's first token output, our method holds promise for future systems integrating LLMs, offering robust real-time detection capabilities. This study advances our understanding of LLM security testing, and lays a critical foundation for the development of more resilient AI systems. <br /> <br />[LLM-PBE: Assessing Data Privacy in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12787) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-06 **Authors** Qinbin Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to numerous domains, significantly advancing applications in data management, mining, and analysis. Their profound capabilities in processing and interpreting complex language data, however, bring to light pressing concerns regarding data privacy, especially the risk of unintentional training data leakage. Despite the critical nature of this issue, there has been no existing literature to offer a comprehensive assessment of data privacy risks in LLMs. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces LLM-PBE, a toolkit crafted specifically for the systematic evaluation of data privacy risks in LLMs. LLM-PBE is designed to analyze privacy across the entire lifecycle of LLMs, incorporating diverse attack and defense strategies, and handling various data types and metrics. Through detailed experimentation with multiple LLMs, LLM-PBE facilitates an in-depth exploration of data privacy concerns, shedding light on influential factors such as model size, data characteristics, and evolving temporal dimensions. This study not only enriches the understanding of privacy issues in LLMs but also serves as a vital resource for future research in the field. Aimed at enhancing the breadth of knowledge in this area, the findings, resources, and our full technical report are made available at https://llm-pbe.github.io/, providing an open platform for academic and practical advancements in LLM privacy assessment. <br /> <br />[Against All Odds: Overcoming Typology, Script, and Language Confusion in Multilingual Embedding Inversion Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11749) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-21 **Authors** Yiyi Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks. <br /> <br />[Virtual Context: Enhancing Jailbreak Attacks with Special Token Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19845) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-11 **Authors** Yuqi Zhou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) involve inducing these models to generate harmful content that violates ethics or laws, posing a significant threat to LLM security. Current jailbreak attacks face two main challenges: low success rates due to defensive measures and high resource requirements for crafting specific prompts. This paper introduces Virtual Context, which leverages special tokens, previously overlooked in LLM security, to improve jailbreak attacks. Virtual Context addresses these challenges by significantly increasing the success rates of existing jailbreak methods and requiring minimal background knowledge about the target model, thus enhancing effectiveness in black-box settings without additional overhead. Comprehensive evaluations show that Virtual Context-assisted jailbreak attacks can improve the success rates of four widely used jailbreak methods by approximately 40% across various LLMs. Additionally, applying Virtual Context to original malicious behaviors still achieves a notable jailbreak effect. In summary, our research highlights the potential of special tokens in jailbreak attacks and recommends including this threat in red-teaming testing to comprehensively enhance LLM security. <br /> <br />[Natural Language but Omitted? On the Ineffectiveness of Large Language Models' privacy policy from End-users' Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18100) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-26 **Authors** Shuning Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> LLMs driven products were increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, With a natural language based interaction style, people may potentially leak their personal private information. Thus, privacy policy and user agreement played an important role in regulating and alerting people. However, there lacked the work examining the reading of LLM's privacy policy. Thus, we conducted the first user study to let participants read the privacy policy and user agreement with two different styles (a cursory and detailed style). We found users lack important information upon cursory reading and even detailed reading. Besides, their privacy concerns was not solved even upon detailed reading. We provided four design implications based on the findings. <br /> <br />[Noisy Neighbors: Efficient membership inference attacks against LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16565) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-24 **Authors** Filippo Galli et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The potential of transformer-based LLMs risks being hindered by privacy concerns due to their reliance on extensive datasets, possibly including sensitive information. Regulatory measures like GDPR and CCPA call for using robust auditing tools to address potential privacy issues, with Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) being the primary method for assessing LLMs' privacy risks. Differently from traditional MIA approaches, often requiring computationally intensive training of additional models, this paper introduces an efficient methodology that generates \textit{noisy neighbors} for a target sample by adding stochastic noise in the embedding space, requiring operating the target model in inference mode only. Our findings demonstrate that this approach closely matches the effectiveness of employing shadow models, showing its usability in practical privacy auditing scenarios. <br /> <br />[Can We Trust Large Language Models Generated Code? A Framework for In-Context Learning, Security Patterns, and Code Evaluations Across Diverse LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12513) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-18 **Authors** Ahmad Mohsin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have revolutionized automated code generation in software engineering. However, as these models are increasingly utilized for software development, concerns have arisen regarding the security and quality of the generated code. These concerns stem from LLMs being primarily trained on publicly available code repositories and internet-based textual data, which may contain insecure code. This presents a significant risk of perpetuating vulnerabilities in the generated code, creating potential attack vectors for exploitation by malicious actors. Our research aims to tackle these issues by introducing a framework for secure behavioral learning of LLMs through In-Content Learning (ICL) patterns during the code generation process, followed by rigorous security evaluations. To achieve this, we have selected four diverse LLMs for experimentation. We have evaluated these coding LLMs across three programming languages and identified security vulnerabilities and code smells. The code is generated through ICL with curated problem sets and undergoes rigorous security testing to evaluate the overall quality and trustworthiness of the generated code. Our research indicates that ICL-driven one-shot and few-shot learning patterns can enhance code security, reducing vulnerabilities in various programming scenarios. Developers and researchers should know that LLMs have a limited understanding of security principles. This may lead to security breaches when the generated code is deployed in production systems. Our research highlights LLMs are a potential source of new vulnerabilities to the software supply chain. It is important to consider this when using LLMs for code generation. This research article offers insights into improving LLM security and encourages proactive use of LLMs for code generation to ensure software system safety. <br /> <br />[Self and Cross-Model Distillation for LLMs: Effective Methods for Refusal Pattern Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11285) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-17 **Authors** Jie Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's LLaMa have shown remarkable capabilities in text generation. However, their susceptibility to toxic prompts presents significant security challenges. This paper investigates alignment techniques, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), to mitigate these risks. We conduct an empirical study on refusal patterns across nine LLMs, revealing that models with uniform refusal patterns, such as Claude3, exhibit higher security. Based on these findings, we propose self-distilling and cross-model distilling methods to enhance LLM security. Our results show that these methods significantly improve refusal rates and reduce unsafe content, with cross-model distilling achieving refusal rates close to Claude3's 94.51%. These findings underscore the potential of distillation-based alignment in securing LLMs against toxic prompts. <br /> <br />[garak: A Framework for Security Probing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11036) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-16 **Authors** Leon Derczynski et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed and integrated into thousands of applications, the need for scalable evaluation of how models respond to adversarial attacks grows rapidly. However, LLM security is a moving target: models produce unpredictable output, are constantly updated, and the potential adversary is highly diverse: anyone with access to the internet and a decent command of natural language. Further, what constitutes a security weak in one context may not be an issue in a different context; one-fits-all guardrails remain theoretical. In this paper, we argue that it is time to rethink what constitutes ``LLM security'', and pursue a holistic approach to LLM security evaluation, where exploration and discovery of issues are central. To this end, this paper introduces garak (Generative AI Red-teaming and Assessment Kit), a framework which can be used to discover and identify vulnerabilities in a target LLM or dialog system. garak probes an LLM in a structured fashion to discover potential vulnerabilities. The outputs of the framework describe a target model's weaknesses, contribute to an informed discussion of what composes vulnerabilities in unique contexts, and can inform alignment and policy discussions for LLM deployment. <br /> <br />[AutoJailbreak: Exploring Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses through a Dependency Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03805) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-06 **Authors** Lin Lu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs) entail inducing the models to generate content that breaches ethical and legal norm through the use of malicious prompts, posing a substantial threat to LLM security. Current strategies for jailbreak attack and defense often focus on optimizing locally within specific algorithmic frameworks, resulting in ineffective optimization and limited scalability. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the dependency relationships in jailbreak attack and defense techniques, generalizing them to all possible attack surfaces. We employ directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to position and analyze existing jailbreak attacks, defenses, and evaluation methodologies, and propose three comprehensive, automated, and logical frameworks. \texttt{AutoAttack} investigates dependencies in two lines of jailbreak optimization strategies: genetic algorithm (GA)-based attacks and adversarial-generation-based attacks, respectively. We then introduce an ensemble jailbreak attack to exploit these dependencies. \texttt{AutoDefense} offers a mixture-of-defenders approach by leveraging the dependency relationships in pre-generative and post-generative defense strategies. \texttt{AutoEvaluation} introduces a novel evaluation method that distinguishes hallucinations, which are often overlooked, from jailbreak attack and defense responses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed ensemble jailbreak attack and defense framework significantly outperforms existing research. <br /> <br />[FastQuery: Communication-efficient Embedding Table Query for Private LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16241) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-25 **Authors** Chenqi Lin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the fast evolution of large language models (LLMs), privacy concerns with user queries arise as they may contain sensitive information. Private inference based on homomorphic encryption (HE) has been proposed to protect user query privacy. However, a private embedding table query has to be formulated as a HE-based matrix-vector multiplication problem and suffers from enormous computation and communication overhead. We observe the overhead mainly comes from the neglect of 1) the one-hot nature of user queries and 2) the robustness of the embedding table to low bit-width quantization noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a private embedding table query optimization framework, dubbed FastQuery. FastQuery features a communication-aware embedding table quantization algorithm and a one-hot-aware dense packing algorithm to simultaneously reduce both the computation and communication costs. Compared to prior-art HE-based frameworks, e.g., Cheetah, Iron, and Bumblebee, FastQuery achieves more than $4.3\times$, $2.7\times$, $1.3\times$ latency reduction, respectively and more than $75.7\times$, $60.2\times$, $20.2\times$ communication reduction, respectively, on both LLAMA-7B and LLAMA-30B. <br /> <br />[Hacc-Man: An Arcade Game for Jailbreaking LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15902) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-24 **Authors** Matheus Valentim et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The recent leaps in complexity and fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs) mean that, for the first time in human history, people can interact with computers using natural language alone. This creates monumental possibilities of automation and accessibility of computing, but also raises severe security and safety threats: When everyone can interact with LLMs, everyone can potentially break into the systems running LLMs. All it takes is creative use of language. This paper presents Hacc-Man, a game which challenges its players to "jailbreak" an LLM: subvert the LLM to output something that it is not intended to. Jailbreaking is at the intersection between creative problem solving and LLM security. The purpose of the game is threefold: 1. To heighten awareness of the risks of deploying fragile LLMs in everyday systems, 2. To heighten people's self-efficacy in interacting with LLMs, and 3. To discover the creative problem solving strategies, people deploy in this novel context. <br /> <br />[SecureLLM: Using Compositionality to Build Provably Secure Language Models for Private, Sensitive, and Secret Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09805) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-13 **Authors** Abdulrahman Alabdulkareem et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Traditional security mechanisms isolate resources from users who should not access them. We reflect the compositional nature of such security mechanisms back into the structure of LLMs to build a provably secure LLM; that we term SecureLLM. Other approaches to LLM safety attempt to protect against bad actors or bad outcomes, but can only do so to an extent making them inappropriate for sensitive data. SecureLLM blends access security with fine-tuning methods. Each data silo has associated with it a separate fine-tuning and a user has access only to the collection of fine-tunings that they have permission for. The model must then perform on compositional tasks at the intersection of those data silos with the combination of those individual fine-tunings. While applicable to any task like document QA or making API calls, in this work we concern ourselves with models that learn the layouts of new SQL databases to provide natural-language-to-SQL translation capabilities. Existing fine-tuning composition methods fail in this challenging environment, as they are not well-equipped for handling compositional tasks. Compositionality remains a challenge for LLMs. We contribute both a difficult new compositional natural-language-to-SQL translation task and a new perspective on LLM security that allows models to be deployed to secure environments today. <br /> <br />[LLM Security Guard for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01103) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-03 **Authors** Arya Kavian et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Many developers rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate software development. Nevertheless, these models have exhibited limited capabilities in the security domain. We introduce LLMSecGuard, a framework to offer enhanced code security through the synergy between static code analyzers and LLMs. LLMSecGuard is open source and aims to equip developers with code solutions that are more secure than the code initially generated by LLMs. This framework also has a benchmarking feature, aimed at providing insights into the evolving security attributes of these models. <br /> <br />[Investigating the prompt leakage effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16251) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-26 **Authors** Divyansh Agarwal et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompt leakage in large language models (LLMs) poses a significant security and privacy threat, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, leakage in multi-turn LLM interactions along with mitigation strategies has not been studied in a standardized manner. This paper investigates LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage across 4 diverse domains and 10 closed- and open-source LLMs. Our unique multi-turn threat model leverages the LLM's sycophancy effect and our analysis dissects task instruction and knowledge leakage in the LLM response. In a multi-turn setting, our threat model elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) to 86.2%, including a 99% leakage with GPT-4 and claude-1.3. We find that some black-box LLMs like Gemini show variable susceptibility to leakage across domains - they are more likely to leak contextual knowledge in the news domain compared to the medical domain. Our experiments measure specific effects of 6 black-box defense strategies, including a query-rewriter in the RAG scenario. Our proposed multi-tier combination of defenses still has an ASR of 5.3% for black-box LLMs, indicating room for enhancement and future direction for LLM security research. <br /> <br />[CyberSecEval 2: A Wide-Ranging Cybersecurity Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13161) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-19 **Authors** Manish Bhatt et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) introduce new security risks, but there are few comprehensive evaluation suites to measure and reduce these risks. We present BenchmarkName, a novel benchmark to quantify LLM security risks and capabilities. We introduce two new areas for testing: prompt injection and code interpreter abuse. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, including GPT-4, Mistral, Meta Llama 3 70B-Instruct, and Code Llama. Our results show that conditioning away risk of attack remains an unsolved problem; for example, all tested models showed between 26% and 41% successful prompt injection tests. We further introduce the safety-utility tradeoff: conditioning an LLM to reject unsafe prompts can cause the LLM to falsely reject answering benign prompts, which lowers utility. We propose quantifying this tradeoff using False Refusal Rate (FRR). As an illustration, we introduce a novel test set to quantify FRR for cyberattack helpfulness risk. We find many LLMs able to successfully comply with "borderline" benign requests while still rejecting most unsafe requests. Finally, we quantify the utility of LLMs for automating a core cybersecurity task, that of exploiting software vulnerabilities. This is important because the offensive capabilities of LLMs are of intense interest; we quantify this by creating novel test sets for four representative problems. We find that models with coding capabilities perform better than those without, but that further work is needed for LLMs to become proficient at exploit generation. Our code is open source and can be used to evaluate other LLMs. <br /> <br />[Private Attribute Inference from Images with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10618) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-16 **Authors** Batuhan Tömekçe et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that the increase in models' capabilities has enabled LLMs to make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a pertinent question is whether such results transfer to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To investigate the risks associated with the image reasoning capabilities of newly emerging VLMs, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the additional privacy risk posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate the inferential capabilities of 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses. <br /> <br />[Unveiling the Misuse Potential of Base Large Language Models via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10552) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-16 **Authors** Xiao Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The open-sourcing of large language models (LLMs) accelerates application development, innovation, and scientific progress. This includes both base models, which are pre-trained on extensive datasets without alignment, and aligned models, deliberately designed to align with ethical standards and human values. Contrary to the prevalent assumption that the inherent instruction-following limitations of base LLMs serve as a safeguard against misuse, our investigation exposes a critical oversight in this belief. By deploying carefully designed demonstrations, our research demonstrates that base LLMs could effectively interpret and execute malicious instructions. To systematically assess these risks, we introduce a novel set of risk evaluation metrics. Empirical results reveal that the outputs from base LLMs can exhibit risk levels on par with those of models fine-tuned for malicious purposes. This vulnerability, requiring neither specialized knowledge nor training, can be manipulated by almost anyone, highlighting the substantial risk and the critical need for immediate attention to the base LLMs' security protocols. <br /> <br />[Subtoxic Questions: Dive Into Attitude Change of LLM's Response in Jailbreak Attempts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08309) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-12 **Authors** Tianyu Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by focusing on a set of target questions that are inherently more sensitive to jailbreak prompts, aiming to circumvent the limitations posed by enhanced LLM security. Through designing and analyzing these sensitive questions, this paper reveals a more effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, thereby contributing to the advancement of LLM security. This research not only challenges existing jailbreaking methodologies but also fortifies LLMs against potential exploits. <br /> <br />[Mapping LLM Security Landscapes: A Comprehensive Stakeholder Risk Assessment Proposal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13309) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Rahul Pankajakshan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse sectors has marked a transformative era, showcasing remarkable capabilities in text generation and problem-solving tasks. However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities. Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences. Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology. To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems. We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors. Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix. We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users. The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies. Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security. <br /> <br />[Ensuring Safe and High-Quality Outputs: A Guideline Library Approach for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11838) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-23 **Authors** Yi Luo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but also present risks such as biased content generation and privacy issues. One of the current alignment techniques includes principle-driven integration, but it faces challenges arising from the imprecision of manually crafted rules and inadequate risk perception in models without safety training. To address these, we introduce Guide-Align, a two-stage approach. Initially, a safety-trained model identifies potential risks and formulates specific guidelines for various inputs, establishing a comprehensive library of guidelines and a model for input-guidelines retrieval. Subsequently, the retrieval model correlates new inputs with relevant guidelines, which guide LLMs in response generation to ensure safe and high-quality outputs, thereby aligning with human values. An additional optional stage involves fine-tuning a model with well-aligned datasets generated through the process implemented in the second stage. Our method customizes guidelines to accommodate diverse inputs, thereby enhancing the fine-grainedness and comprehensiveness of the guideline library. Furthermore, it incorporates safety expertise from a safety-trained LLM through a lightweight retrieval model. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in LLM security and quality. Notably, our fine-tuned model, Labrador, even at 13 billion parameters, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses GPT-4 in alignment capabilities. <br /> <br />[Tastle: Distract Large Language Models for Automatic Jailbreak Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08424) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-13 **Authors** Zeguan Xiao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in recent days. Extensive efforts have been made before the public release of LLMs to align their behaviors with human values. The primary goal of alignment is to ensure their helpfulness, honesty and harmlessness. However, even meticulously aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to malicious manipulations such as jailbreaking, leading to unintended behaviors. The jailbreak is to intentionally develop a malicious prompt that escapes from the LLM security restrictions to produce uncensored detrimental contents. Previous works explore different jailbreak methods for red teaming LLMs, yet they encounter challenges regarding to effectiveness and scalability. In this work, we propose Tastle, a novel black-box jailbreak framework for automated red teaming of LLMs. We designed malicious content concealing and memory reframing with an iterative optimization algorithm to jailbreak LLMs, motivated by the research about the distractibility and over-confidence phenomenon of LLMs. Extensive experiments of jailbreaking both open-source and proprietary LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of effectiveness, scalability and transferability. We also evaluate the effectiveness of existing jailbreak defense methods against our attack and highlight the crucial need to develop more effective and practical defense strategies. <br /> <br />[On Protecting the Data Privacy of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05156) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-14 **Authors** Biwei Yan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) are complex artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding, generating and translating human language. They learn language patterns by analyzing large amounts of text data, allowing them to perform writing, conversation, summarizing and other language tasks. When LLMs process and generate large amounts of data, there is a risk of leaking sensitive information, which may threaten data privacy. This paper concentrates on elucidating the data privacy concerns associated with LLMs to foster a comprehensive understanding. Specifically, a thorough investigation is undertaken to delineate the spectrum of data privacy threats, encompassing both passive privacy leakage and active privacy attacks within LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct an assessment of the privacy protection mechanisms employed by LLMs at various stages, followed by a detailed examination of their efficacy and constraints. Finally, the discourse extends to delineate the challenges encountered and outline prospective directions for advancement in the realm of LLM privacy protection. <br /> <br />[A New Era in LLM Security: Exploring Security Concerns in Real-World LLM-based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18649) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Fangzhou Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Model (LLM) systems are inherently compositional, with individual LLM serving as the core foundation with additional layers of objects such as plugins, sandbox, and so on. Along with the great potential, there are also increasing concerns over the security of such probabilistic intelligent systems. However, existing studies on LLM security often focus on individual LLM, but without examining the ecosystem through the lens of LLM systems with other objects (e.g., Frontend, Webtool, Sandbox, and so on). In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of LLM systems, instead of focusing on the individual LLMs. To do so, we build on top of the information flow and formulate the security of LLM systems as constraints on the alignment of the information flow within LLM and between LLM and other objects. Based on this construction and the unique probabilistic nature of LLM, the attack surface of the LLM system can be decomposed into three key components: (1) multi-layer security analysis, (2) analysis of the existence of constraints, and (3) analysis of the robustness of these constraints. To ground this new attack surface, we propose a multi-layer and multi-step approach and apply it to the state-of-art LLM system, OpenAI GPT4. Our investigation exposes several security issues, not just within the LLM model itself but also in its integration with other components. We found that although the OpenAI GPT4 has designed numerous safety constraints to improve its safety features, these safety constraints are still vulnerable to attackers. To further demonstrate the real-world threats of our discovered vulnerabilities, we construct an end-to-end attack where an adversary can illicitly acquire the user's chat history, all without the need to manipulate the user's input or gain direct access to OpenAI GPT4. Our demo is in the link: https://fzwark.github.io/LLM-System-Attack-Demo/ <br /> <br />[Making Them Ask and Answer: Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Few Queries via Disguise and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18104) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-10 **Authors** Tong Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable success across various tasks, but the trustworthiness of LLMs is still an open problem. One specific threat is the potential to generate toxic or harmful responses. Attackers can craft adversarial prompts that induce harmful responses from LLMs. In this work, we pioneer a theoretical foundation in LLMs security by identifying bias vulnerabilities within the safety fine-tuning and design a black-box jailbreak method named DRA (Disguise and Reconstruction Attack), which conceals harmful instructions through disguise and prompts the model to reconstruct the original harmful instruction within its completion. We evaluate DRA across various open-source and closed-source models, showcasing state-of-the-art jailbreak success rates and attack efficiency. Notably, DRA boasts a 91.1% attack success rate on OpenAI GPT-4 chatbot. <br /> <br />[Pandora's White-Box: Precise Training Data Detection and Extraction in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17012) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-28 **Authors** Jeffrey G. Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In this paper we develop state-of-the-art privacy attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs), where an adversary with some access to the model tries to learn something about the underlying training data. Our headline results are new membership inference attacks (MIAs) against pretrained LLMs that perform hundreds of times better than baseline attacks, and a pipeline showing that over 50% (!) of the fine-tuning dataset can be extracted from a fine-tuned LLM in natural settings. We consider varying degrees of access to the underlying model, pretraining and fine-tuning data, and both MIAs and training data extraction. For pretraining data, we propose two new MIAs: a supervised neural network classifier that predicts training data membership on the basis of (dimensionality-reduced) model gradients, as well as a variant of this attack that only requires logit access to the model which leverages recent model-stealing work on LLMs. To our knowledge this is the first MIA that explicitly incorporates model-stealing information. Both attacks outperform existing black-box baselines, and our supervised attack closes the gap between MIA attack success against LLMs and the strongest known attacks for other machine learning models. In fine-tuning, we find that a simple attack based on the ratio of the loss between the base and fine-tuned models is able to achieve near-perfect MIA performance; we then leverage our MIA to extract a large fraction of the fine-tuning dataset from fine-tuned Pythia and Llama models. Taken together, these results represent the strongest existing privacy attacks against both pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs for MIAs and training data extraction, which are of independent scientific interest and have important practical implications for LLM security, privacy, and copyright issues. <br /> <br />[ASETF: A Novel Method for Jailbreak Attack on LLMs through Translate Suffix Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16006) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-04 **Authors** Hao Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The safety defense methods of Large language models(LLMs) stays limited because the dangerous prompts are manually curated to just few known attack types, which fails to keep pace with emerging varieties. Recent studies found that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous outputs. However, similar to traditional text adversarial attacks, this approach, while effective, is limited by the challenge of the discrete tokens. This gradient based discrete optimization attack requires over 100,000 LLM calls, and due to the unreadable of adversarial suffixes, it can be relatively easily penetrated by common defense methods such as perplexity filters. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we proposes an Adversarial Suffix Embedding Translation Framework (ASETF), aimed at transforming continuous adversarial suffix embeddings into coherent and understandable text. This method greatly reduces the computational overhead during the attack process and helps to automatically generate multiple adversarial samples, which can be used as data to strengthen LLMs security defense. Experimental evaluations were conducted on Llama2, Vicuna, and other prominent LLMs, employing harmful directives sourced from the Advbench dataset. The results indicate that our method significantly reduces the computation time of adversarial suffixes and achieves a much better attack success rate to existing techniques, while significantly enhancing the textual fluency of the prompts. In addition, our approach can be generalized into a broader method for generating transferable adversarial suffixes that can successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-box LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini. <br /> <br />[Is the System Message Really Important to Jailbreaks in Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14857) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-18 **Authors** Xiaotian Zou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has rendered them indispensable in modern society. While security measures are typically to align LLMs with human values prior to release, recent studies have unveiled a concerning phenomenon named "Jailbreak". This term refers to the unexpected and potentially harmful responses generated by LLMs when prompted with malicious questions. Most existing research focus on generating jailbreak prompts but system message configurations vary significantly in experiments. In this paper, we aim to answer a question: Is the system message really important for jailbreaks in LLMs? We conduct experiments in mainstream LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts with varying system messages: short, long, and none. We discover that different system messages have distinct resistances to jailbreaks. Therefore, we explore the transferability of jailbreaks across LLMs with different system messages. Furthermore, we propose the System Messages Evolutionary Algorithm (SMEA) to generate system messages that are more resistant to jailbreak prompts, even with minor changes. Through SMEA, we get a robust system messages population with little change in the length of system messages. Our research not only bolsters LLMs security but also raises the bar for jailbreaks, fostering advancements in this field of study. <br /> <br />[A Comprehensive Study of Jailbreak Attack versus Defense for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13457) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-17 **Authors** Zihao Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMS) have increasingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts. Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security. We believe these contributions will facilitate the exploration of security measures within this domain. <br /> <br />[StruQ: Defending Against Prompt Injection with Structured Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06363) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-25 **Authors** Sizhe Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable exciting LLM-integrated applications, which perform text-based tasks by utilizing their advanced language understanding capabilities. However, as LLMs have improved, so have the attacks against them. Prompt injection attacks are an important threat: they trick the model into deviating from the original application's instructions and instead follow user directives. These attacks rely on the LLM's ability to follow instructions and inability to separate prompts and user data. We introduce structured queries, a general approach to tackle this problem. Structured queries separate prompts and data into two channels. We implement a system that supports structured queries. This system is made of (1) a secure front-end that formats a prompt and user data into a special format, and (2) a specially trained LLM that can produce high-quality outputs from these inputs. The LLM is trained using a novel fine-tuning strategy: we convert a base (non-instruction-tuned) LLM to a structured instruction-tuned model that will only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query. To do so, we augment standard instruction tuning datasets with examples that also include instructions in the data portion of the query, and fine-tune the model to ignore these. Our system significantly improves resistance to prompt injection attacks, with little or no impact on utility. Our code is released at https://github.com/Sizhe-Chen/StruQ. <br /> <br />[Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-31 **Authors** Yichuan Mo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/PAT. <br /> <br />[Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12192) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Yiyi Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Textual data is often represented as real-numbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be susceptible to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages potentially exposed to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, and explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English-based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings. <br /> <br />[A Comprehensive Survey of Attack Techniques, Implementation, and Mitigation Strategies in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10982) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-18 **Authors** Aysan Esmradi et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) is an ongoing challenge despite their widespread popularity. Developers work to enhance LLMs security, but vulnerabilities persist, even in advanced versions like GPT-4. Attackers exploit these weaknesses, highlighting the need for proactive cybersecurity measures in AI model development. This article explores two attack categories: attacks on models themselves and attacks on model applications. The former requires expertise, access to model data, and significant implementation time, while the latter is more accessible to attackers and has seen increased attention. Our study reviews over 100 recent research works, providing an in-depth analysis of each attack type. We identify the latest attack methods and explore various approaches to carry them out. We thoroughly investigate mitigation techniques, assessing their effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, we summarize future defenses against these attacks. We also examine real-world techniques, including reported and our implemented attacks on LLMs, to consolidate our findings. Our research highlights the urgency of addressing security concerns and aims to enhance the understanding of LLM attacks, contributing to robust defense development in this evolving domain. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Privacy: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02003) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Yifan Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into "The Good" (beneficial LLM applications), "The Bad" (offensive applications), and "The Ugly" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity. <br /> <br />[Reducing Privacy Risks in Online Self-Disclosures with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09538) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Yao Dou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Self-disclosure, while being common and rewarding in social media interaction, also poses privacy risks. In this paper, we take the initiative to protect the user-side privacy associated with online self-disclosure through detection and abstraction. We develop a taxonomy of 19 self-disclosure categories and curate a large corpus consisting of 4.8K annotated disclosure spans. We then fine-tune a language model for detection, achieving over 65% partial span F $_1$ . We further conduct an HCI user study, with 82% of participants viewing the model positively, highlighting its real-world applicability. Motivated by the user feedback, we introduce the task of self-disclosure abstraction, which is paraphrasing disclosures into less specific terms while preserving their utility, e.g., "Im 16F" to "I'm a teenage girl". We explore various fine-tuning strategies, and our best model can generate diverse abstractions that moderately reduce privacy risks while maintaining high utility according to human evaluation. To help users in deciding which disclosures to abstract, we present a task of rating their importance for context understanding. Our fine-tuned model achieves 80% accuracy, on-par with GPT-3.5. Given safety and privacy considerations, we will only release our corpus to researchers who agree to ethical guidelines. <br /> <br />[Prompt Packer: Deceiving LLMs through Compositional Instruction with Hidden Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10077) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-16 **Authors** Shuyu Jiang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recently, Large language models (LLMs) with powerful general capabilities have been increasingly integrated into various Web applications, while undergoing alignment training to ensure that the generated content aligns with user intent and ethics. Unfortunately, they remain the risk of generating harmful content like hate speech and criminal activities in practical applications. Current approaches primarily rely on detecting, collecting, and training against harmful prompts to prevent such risks. However, they typically focused on the "superficial" harmful prompts with a solitary intent, ignoring composite attack instructions with multiple intentions that can easily elicit harmful content in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique for obfuscating harmful instructions: Compositional Instruction Attacks (CIA), which refers to attacking by combination and encapsulation of multiple instructions. CIA hides harmful prompts within instructions of harmless intentions, making it impossible for the model to identify underlying malicious intentions. Furthermore, we implement two transformation methods, known as T-CIA and W-CIA, to automatically disguise harmful instructions as talking or writing tasks, making them appear harmless to LLMs. We evaluated CIA on GPT-4, ChatGPT, and ChatGLM2 with two safety assessment datasets and two harmful prompt datasets. It achieves an attack success rate of 95%+ on safety assessment datasets, and 83%+ for GPT-4, 91%+ for ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo backed) and ChatGLM2-6B on harmful prompt datasets. Our approach reveals the vulnerability of LLMs to such compositional instruction attacks that harbor underlying harmful intentions, contributing significantly to LLM security development.

At the same time, models' inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals' privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to $85\%$ top-1 and $95\%$ top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost ($100\times$) and time ($240\times$ ) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection. <br /> <br />[Baseline Defenses for Adversarial Attacks Against Aligned Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00614) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-04 **Authors** Neel Jain et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models quickly become ubiquitous, it becomes critical to understand their security vulnerabilities. Recent work shows that text optimizers can produce jailbreaking prompts that bypass moderation and alignment. Drawing from the rich body of work on adversarial machine learning, we approach these attacks with three questions: What threat models are practically useful in this domain? How do baseline defense techniques perform in this new domain? How does LLM security differ from computer vision?   We evaluate several baseline defense strategies against leading adversarial attacks on LLMs, discussing the various settings in which each is feasible and effective. Particularly, we look at three types of defenses: detection (perplexity based), input preprocessing (paraphrase and retokenization), and adversarial training. We discuss white-box and gray-box settings and discuss the robustness-performance trade-off for each of the defenses considered. We find that the weakness of existing discrete optimizers for text, combined with the relatively high costs of optimization, makes standard adaptive attacks more challenging for LLMs. Future research will be needed to uncover whether more powerful optimizers can be developed, or whether the strength of filtering and preprocessing defenses is greater in the LLMs domain than it has been in computer vision. <br /> <br />[Multi-step Jailbreaking Privacy Attacks on ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05197) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-01 **Authors** Haoran Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), many downstream NLP tasks can be well solved given appropriate prompts. Though model developers and researchers work hard on dialog safety to avoid generating harmful content from LLMs, it is still challenging to steer AI-generated content (AIGC) for the human good. As powerful LLMs are devouring existing text data from various domains (e.g., GPT-3 is trained on 45TB texts), it is natural to doubt whether the private information is included in the training data and what privacy threats can these LLMs and their downstream applications bring. In this paper, we study the privacy threats from OpenAI's ChatGPT and the New Bing enhanced by ChatGPT and show that application-integrated LLMs may cause new privacy threats. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments to support our claims and discuss LLMs' privacy implications. <br /> <br />
## LLM Applications

[Focus On This, Not That! Steering LLMs With Adaptive Feature Specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22944) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-30 **Authors** Tom A. Lamb et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Despite the success of Instruction Tuning (IT) in training large language models (LLMs) to perform arbitrary user-specified tasks, these models often still leverage spurious or biased features learned from their training data, leading to undesired behaviours when deploying them in new contexts. In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments. <br /> <br />[Whose ChatGPT? Unveiling Real-World Educational Inequalities Introduced by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22282) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-29 **Authors** Renzhe Yu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The universal availability of ChatGPT and other similar tools since late 2022 has prompted tremendous public excitement and experimental effort about the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve learning experience and outcomes, especially for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, little research has systematically examined the real-world impacts of LLM availability on educational equity beyond theoretical projections and controlled studies of innovative LLM applications. To depict trends of post-LLM inequalities, we analyze 1,140,328 academic writing submissions from 16,791 college students across 2,391 courses between 2021 and 2024 at a public, minority-serving institution in the US. We find that students' overall writing quality gradually increased following the availability of LLMs and that the writing quality gaps between linguistically advantaged and disadvantaged students became increasingly narrower. However, this equitizing effect was more concentrated on students with higher socioeconomic status. These findings shed light on the digital divides in the era of LLMs and raise questions about the equity benefits of LLMs in early stages and highlight the need for researchers and practitioners on developing responsible practices to improve educational equity through LLMs. <br /> <br />[SG-Bench: Evaluating LLM Safety Generalization Across Diverse Tasks and Prompt Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21965) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-29 **Authors** Yutao Mou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Ensuring the safety of large language model (LLM) applications is essential for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence. Current LLM safety benchmarks have two limitations. First, they focus solely on either discriminative or generative evaluation paradigms while ignoring their interconnection. Second, they rely on standardized inputs, overlooking the effects of widespread prompting techniques, such as system prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought prompting. To overcome these issues, we developed SG-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the generalization of LLM safety across various tasks and prompt types. This benchmark integrates both generative and discriminative evaluation tasks and includes extended data to examine the impact of prompt engineering and jailbreak on LLM safety. Our assessment of 3 advanced proprietary LLMs and 10 open-source LLMs with the benchmark reveals that most LLMs perform worse on discriminative tasks than generative ones, and are highly susceptible to prompts, indicating poor generalization in safety alignment. We also explain these findings quantitatively and qualitatively to provide insights for future research. <br /> <br />[Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs): Improved Prompt Injection Attacks Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21337) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-28 **Authors** Md Abdur Rahman et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a popular tool as they have significantly advanced in their capability to tackle a wide range of language-based tasks. However, LLMs applications are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which poses a critical problem. These attacks target LLMs applications through using carefully designed input prompts to divert the model from adhering to original instruction, thereby it could execute unintended actions. These manipulations pose serious security threats which potentially results in data leaks, biased outputs, or harmful responses. This project explores the security vulnerabilities in relation to prompt injection attacks. To detect whether a prompt is vulnerable or not, we follows two approaches: 1) a pre-trained LLM, and 2) a fine-tuned LLM. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the classification performance. Firstly, we use pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model to detect prompt injections using test dataset without any fine-tuning and evaluate it by zero-shot classification. Then, this proposed work will apply supervised fine-tuning to this pre-trained LLM using a task-specific labeled dataset from deepset in huggingface, and this fine-tuned model achieves impressive results with 99.13\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 98.33\% recall and 99.15\% F1-score thorough rigorous experimentation and evaluation. We observe that our approach is highly efficient in detecting prompt injection attacks. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Speech Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18908) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-25 **Authors** Jing Peng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multi-task performance. Therefore, researchers have been seeking to integrate LLMs in the broad sense of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) field. Different from the traditional method of cascading LLMs to process text generated by Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), new efforts have focused on designing architectures centered around Audio Feature Extraction - Multimodal Information Fusion - LLM Inference(Speech LLMs). This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while simultaneously facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures and training strategies. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses Speech LLMs' advancements in Rich Audio Transcription and its potential for Cross-task Integration within the SLU field. Additionally, it indicates key challenges uncovered through experimentation, such as the Dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further delves into the training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposing potential solutions based on these findings, and offering valuable insights and references for future research in this domain, as well as LLM applications in multimodal contexts. <br /> <br />[Fast Inference for Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18248) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-25 **Authors** Rana Shahout et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM. <br /> <br />[From PDFs to Structured Data: Utilizing LLM Analysis in Sports Database Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17619) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-31 **Authors** Juhani Merilehto et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing semi-structured data from PDF documents into structured formats, specifically examining their application in updating the Finnish Sports Clubs Database. Through action research methodology, we developed and evaluated an AI-assisted approach utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus models to process data from 72 sports federation membership reports. The system achieved a 90% success rate in automated processing, successfully handling 65 of 72 files without errors and converting over 7,900 rows of data. While the initial development time was comparable to traditional manual processing (three months), the implemented system shows potential for reducing future processing time by approximately 90%. Key challenges included handling multilingual content, processing multi-page datasets, and managing extraneous information. The findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrate significant potential for automating semi-structured data processing tasks, optimal results are achieved through a hybrid approach combining AI automation with selective human oversight. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical LLM applications in organizational data management and provides insights into the transformation of traditional data processing workflows. <br /> <br />[On the use of Large Language Models in Model-Driven Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17370) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-22 **Authors** Juri Di Rocco et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has seen significant advancements with the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Building upon the groundwork of previous investigations, our study provides a concise overview of current Language Large Models (LLMs) applications in MDE, emphasizing their role in automating tasks like model repository classification and developing advanced recommender systems. The paper also outlines the technical considerations for seamlessly integrating LLMs in MDE, offering a practical guide for researchers and practitioners. Looking forward, the paper proposes a focused research agenda for the future interplay of LLMs and MDE, identifying key challenges and opportunities. This concise roadmap envisions the deployment of LLM techniques to enhance the management, exploration, and evolution of modeling ecosystems. By offering a compact exploration of LLMs in MDE, this paper contributes to the ongoing evolution of MDE practices, providing a forward-looking perspective on the transformative role of Language Large Models in software engineering and model-driven practices. <br /> <br />[Large language models enabled multiagent ensemble method for efficient EHR data labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16543) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-21 **Authors** Jingwei Huang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study introduces a novel multiagent ensemble method powered by LLMs to address a key challenge in ML - data labeling, particularly in large-scale EHR datasets. Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its effectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG dataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from the clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of diverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's prediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal winning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for EHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language processing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an estimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify SDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving competitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can outperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces hallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs method significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling large-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality; (2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by its application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse LLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and (4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors. This approach provides a scalable and efficient solution to data-labeling challenges. <br /> <br />[Mesa-Extrapolation: A Weave Position Encoding Method for Enhanced Extrapolation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15859) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-24 **Authors** Xin Ma et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs), although having revolutionized many fields, still suffer from the challenging extrapolation problem, where the inference ability of LLMs sharply declines beyond their max training lengths. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/soacker/Mesa-Extrapolation}. <br /> <br />[Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning and Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15483) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-28 **Authors** Heshan Fernando et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/heshandevaka/XRIGHT. <br /> <br />[ET-Plan-Bench: Embodied Task-level Planning Benchmark Towards Spatial-Temporal Cognition with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14682) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-02 **Authors** Lingfeng Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred numerous attempts to apply these technologies to embodied tasks, particularly focusing on high-level task planning and task decomposition. To further explore this area, we introduce a new embodied task planning benchmark, ET-Plan-Bench, which specifically targets embodied task planning using LLMs. It features a controllable and diverse set of embodied tasks varying in different levels of difficulties and complexities, and is designed to evaluate two critical dimensions of LLMs' application in embodied task understanding: spatial (relation constraint, occlusion for target objects) and temporal & causal understanding of the sequence of actions in the environment. By using multi-source simulators as the backend simulator, it can provide immediate environment feedback to LLMs, which enables LLMs to interact dynamically with the environment and re-plan as necessary. We evaluated the state-of-the-art open source and closed source foundation models, including GPT-4, LLAMA and Mistral on our proposed benchmark. While they perform adequately well on simple navigation tasks, their performance can significantly deteriorate when faced with tasks that require a deeper understanding of spatial, temporal, and causal relationships. Thus, our benchmark distinguishes itself as a large-scale, quantifiable, highly automated, and fine-grained diagnostic framework that presents a significant challenge to the latest foundation models. We hope it can spark and drive further research in embodied task planning using foundation models. <br /> <br />[Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhancing Public Transit Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14147) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-18 **Authors** Jiahao Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Public transit systems play a crucial role in providing efficient and sustainable transportation options in urban areas. However, these systems face various challenges in meeting commuters' needs. On the other hand, despite the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) worldwide, their integration into transit systems remains relatively unexplored.   The objective of this paper is to explore the utilization of LLMs in the public transit system, with a specific focus on improving the customers' experience and transit staff performance. We present a general framework for developing LLM applications in transit systems, wherein the LLM serves as the intermediary for information communication between natural language content and the resources within the database. In this context, the LLM serves a multifaceted role, including understanding users' requirements, retrieving data from the dataset in response to user queries, and tailoring the information to align with the users' specific needs. Three transit LLM applications are presented: Tweet Writer, Trip Advisor, and Policy Navigator. Tweet Writer automates updates to the transit system alerts on social media, Trip Advisor offers customized transit trip suggestions, and Policy Navigator provides clear and personalized answers to policy queries. Leveraging LLMs in these applications enhances seamless communication with their capabilities of understanding and generating human-like languages. With the help of these three LLM transit applications, transit system media personnel can provide system updates more efficiently, and customers can access travel information and policy answers in a more user-friendly manner. <br /> <br />[Qtok: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Multilingual Tokenizer Quality in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12989) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-16 **Authors** Iaroslav Chelombitko et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), considerable attention has been given to the quality of training datasets. However, the role of tokenizers in the LLM training pipeline, particularly for multilingual models, has received less focus. The quality of tokenization can significantly impact a model's ability to handle diverse languages effectively. We introduce Qtok, a tool designed to assess tokenizer quality with a specific emphasis on their performance in multilingual contexts.   Our research proposes a set of metrics for evaluating tokenizer quality, including measures of language coverage, token completeness, and distribution across languages and linguistic categories. Qtok applies these metrics to evaluate 13 distinct tokenizers from 58 publicly available models, analyzing their output across different linguistic contexts. Our analysis revealed significant variations in token distribution across languages and categories, highlighting potential biases and areas for improvement in current tokenization strategies.   This research contributes to the field of tokenizer evaluation within multilingual LLM development by providing a systematic approach to assessing tokenizer quality. Our findings highlight the critical role of tokenization in multilingual LLM capability. The Qtok tool and our analysis methodology offer practical means for researchers to evaluate and improve tokenization strategies for multilingual applications. We offer a method to compare tokenizer quality across these metrics, which may be useful when selecting or adjusting tokenizers for specific multilingual LLM applications. <br /> <br />[A Review on Edge Large Language Models: Design, Execution, and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11845) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-29 **Authors** Yue Zheng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their exceptional capabilities. However, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational limitations, memory constraints, and edge hardware heterogeneity. This survey summarizes recent developments in edge LLMs across their lifecycle, examining resource-efficient designs from pre-deployment techniques to runtime optimizations. Additionally, it explores on-device LLM applications in personal, enterprise, and industrial scenarios. By synthesizing advancements and identifying future directions, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art methods for deploying LLMs on edge devices, bridging the gap between their immense potential and edge computing limitations. <br /> <br />[MathHay: An Automated Benchmark for Long-Context Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04698) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-07 **Authors** Lei Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated versatile capabilities in long-context scenarios. Although some recent benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the long-context capabilities of LLMs, there is a lack of benchmarks evaluating the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs over long contexts, which is crucial for LLMs' application in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce MathHay, an automated benchmark designed to assess the long-context mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike previous benchmarks like Needle in a Haystack, which focus primarily on information retrieval within long texts, MathHay demands models with both information-seeking and complex mathematical reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments on MathHay to assess the long-context mathematical reasoning abilities of eight top-performing LLMs. Even the best-performing model, Gemini-1.5-Pro-002, still struggles with mathematical reasoning over long contexts, achieving only 51.26% accuracy at 128K tokens. This highlights the significant room for improvement on the MathHay benchmark. <br /> <br />[Large Language Model Performance Benchmarking on Mobile Platforms: A Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03613) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-04 **Authors** Jie Xiao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of our work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which push the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture. <br /> <br />[InfiniPot: Infinite Context Processing on Memory-Constrained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01518) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-02 **Authors** Minsoo Kim et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Handling long input contexts remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios. <br /> <br />[Don't Stop Me Now: Embedding Based Scheduling for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01035) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-01 **Authors** Rana Shahout et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Efficient scheduling is crucial for interactive Large Language Model (LLM) applications, where low request completion time directly impacts user engagement. Size-based scheduling algorithms like Shortest Remaining Process Time (SRPT) aim to reduce average request completion time by leveraging known or estimated request sizes and allowing preemption by incoming jobs with shorter service times. However, two main challenges arise when applying size-based scheduling to LLM systems. First, accurately predicting output lengths from prompts is challenging and often resource-intensive, making it impractical for many systems. As a result, the state-of-the-art LLM systems default to first-come, first-served scheduling, which can lead to head-of-line blocking and reduced system efficiency. Second, preemption introduces extra memory overhead to LLM systems as they must maintain intermediate states for unfinished (preempted) requests. In this paper, we propose TRAIL, a method to obtain output predictions from the target LLM itself. After generating each output token, we recycle the embedding of its internal structure as input for a lightweight classifier that predicts the remaining length for each running request. Using these predictions, we propose a prediction-based SRPT variant with limited preemption designed to account for memory overhead in LLM systems. This variant allows preemption early in request execution when memory consumption is low but restricts preemption as requests approach completion to optimize resource utilization. On the theoretical side, we derive a closed-form formula for this SRPT variant in an M/G/1 queue model, which demonstrates its potential value. In our system, we implement this preemption policy alongside our embedding-based prediction method. <br /> <br />[What is the Role of Large Language Models in the Evolution of Astronomy Research?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20252) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-01 **Authors** Morgan Fouesneau et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for rigorous scientific inquiry. <br /> <br />[Outlining the Borders for LLM Applications in Patient Education: Developing an Expert-in-the-Loop LLM-Powered Chatbot for Prostate Cancer Patient Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19100) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-27 **Authors** Yuexing Hao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Cancer patients often struggle to transition swiftly to treatment due to limited institutional resources, lack of sophisticated professional guidance, and low health literacy. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for such patients to access the wealth of existing patient education materials. The current paper presents the development process for an LLM-based chatbot focused on prostate cancer education, including needs assessment, co-design, and usability studies. The resulting application, MedEduChat, integrates with patients' electronic health record data and features a closed-domain, semi-structured, patient-centered approach to address real-world needs. This paper contributes to the growing field of patient-LLM interaction by demonstrating the potential of LLM-based chatbots to enhance prostate cancer patient education and by offering co-design guidelines for future LLM-based healthcare downstream applications. <br /> <br />[Data-Prep-Kit: getting your data ready for LLM application development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18164) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-26 **Authors** David Wood et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Data preparation is the first and a very important step towards any Large Language Model (LLM) development. This paper introduces an easy-to-use, extensible, and scale-flexible open-source data preparation toolkit called Data Prep Kit (DPK). DPK is architected and designed to enable users to scale their data preparation to their needs. With DPK they can prepare data on a local machine or effortlessly scale to run on a cluster with thousands of CPU Cores. DPK comes with a highly scalable, yet extensible set of modules that transform natural language and code data. If the user needs additional transforms, they can be easily developed using extensive DPK support for transform creation. These modules can be used independently or pipelined to perform a series of operations. In this paper, we describe DPK architecture and show its performance from a small scale to a very large number of CPUs. The modules from DPK have been used for the preparation of Granite Models [1] [2]. We believe DPK is a valuable contribution to the AI community to easily prepare data to enhance the performance of their LLM models or to fine-tune models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). <br /> <br />[Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18009) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-26 **Authors** Yuchen Xia et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction. We provide demo videos and detailed data on GitHub: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLM4IAS <br /> <br />[CSPS: A Communication-Efficient Sequence-Parallelism based Serving System for Transformer based Models with Long Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15104) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-23 **Authors** Zeyu Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Long-sequence generative large-language model (LLM) applications have become increasingly popular. In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found that the existing method for long sequences results in a high Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and low throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures for both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two challenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance bottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and SP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication for decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse Attention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase pipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately from prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and novelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication overhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient Sequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response time by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode throughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to Sarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code. <br /> <br />[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey on How to Make your LLMs use External Data More Wisely](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14924) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-23 **Authors** Siyun Zhao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in completing real-world tasks. Techniques for integrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread application. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs across various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These challenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and accurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice, underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core focus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple capabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey, we propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four levels based on the type of external data required and primary focus of the task: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale queries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries, provide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective techniques for addressing these challenges. Finally, we discuss three main forms of integrating external data into LLMs: context, small model, and fine-tuning, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and the types of problems they are suited to solve. This work aims to help readers thoroughly understand and decompose the data requirements and key bottlenecks in building LLM applications, offering solutions to the different challenges and serving as a guide to systematically developing such applications. <br /> <br />[Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13761) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-21 **Authors** Yihua Cheng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache. <br /> <br />[Applying Pre-trained Multilingual BERT in Embeddings for Improved Malicious Prompt Injection Attacks Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13331) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-20 **Authors** Md Abdur Rahman et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their exceptional capabilities, and applying to a wide range of applications. However, this widespread use brings significant vulnerabilities. Also, it is well observed that there are huge gap which lies in the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies against malicious prompt injection attacks in large language models, as current approaches may not adequately address the complexity and evolving nature of these vulnerabilities in real-world applications. Therefore, this work focuses the impact of malicious prompt injection attacks which is one of most dangerous vulnerability on real LLMs applications. It examines to apply various BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) like multilingual BERT, DistilBert for classifying malicious prompts from legitimate prompts. Also, we observed how tokenizing the prompt texts and generating embeddings using multilingual BERT contributes to improve the performance of various machine learning methods: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The performance of each model is rigorously analyzed with various parameters to improve the binary classification to discover malicious prompts. Multilingual BERT approach to embed the prompts significantly improved and outperformed the existing works and achieves an outstanding accuracy of 96.55% by Logistic regression. Additionally, we investigated the incorrect predictions of the model to gain insights into its limitations. The findings can guide researchers in tuning various BERT for finding the most suitable model for diverse LLMs vulnerabilities. <br /> <br />[To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12183) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-29 **Authors** Zayne Sprague et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications. <br /> <br />[MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10064) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-16 **Authors** Sijie Ji et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, affecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those affected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible, stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to provide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention conversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices involving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the model size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive, integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and stigma-free mental health support. <br /> <br />[Language Models "Grok" to Copy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09281) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-14 **Authors** Ang Lv et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying. <br /> <br />[Understanding Knowledge Drift in LLMs through Misinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07085) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-11 **Authors** Alina Fastowski et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem. However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation. We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models. We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics. Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information. At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t. the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains. The code is available at https://github.com/afastowski/knowledge_drift. <br /> <br />[Investigating LLM Applications in E-Commerce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12779) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-23 **Authors** Chester Palen-Michel et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing in various applications especially in e-commerce. One crucial step before the application of such LLMs in these fields is to understand and compare the performance in different use cases in such tasks. This paper explored the efficacy of LLMs in the e-commerce domain, focusing on instruction-tuning an open source LLM model with public e-commerce datasets of varying sizes and comparing the performance with the conventional models prevalent in industrial applications. We conducted a comprehensive comparison between LLMs and traditional pre-trained language models across specific tasks intrinsic to the e-commerce domain, namely classification, generation, summarization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, we examined the effectiveness of the current niche industrial application of very large LLM, using in-context learning, in e-commerce specific tasks. Our findings indicate that few-shot inference with very large LLMs often does not outperform fine-tuning smaller pre-trained models, underscoring the importance of task-specific model optimization.Additionally, we investigated different training methodologies such as single-task training, mixed-task training, and LoRA merging both within domain/tasks and between different tasks. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, this paper offers valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of LLMs to advance natural language processing capabilities within the e-commerce industry. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models Are Self-Taught Reasoners: Enhancing LLM Applications via Tailored Problem-Solving Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12315) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-22 **Authors** Kai Tzu-iunn Ong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Guiding large language models with a selected set of human-authored demonstrations is a common practice for improving LLM applications. However, human effort can be costly, especially in specialized domains (e.g., clinical diagnosis), and does not guarantee optimal performance due to the potential discrepancy of target skills between selected demonstrations and real test instances. Motivated by these, this paper explores the automatic creation of customized demonstrations, whose target skills align with the given target instance. We present SELF-TAUGHT, a problem-solving framework, which facilitates demonstrations that are "tailored" to the target problem and "filtered" for better quality (i.e., correctness) in a zero-shot manner. In 15 tasks of multiple-choice questions of diverse domains and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with real-world patients, SELF-TAUGHT achieves superior performance to strong baselines (e.g., Few-shot CoT, Plan-and-Solve, Auto-CoT). We conduct comprehensive analyses on SELF-TAUGHT, including its generalizability to existing prompting methods and different LLMs, the quality of its intermediate generation, and more. <br /> <br />[MEGen: Generative Backdoor in Large Language Models via Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10722) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-20 **Authors** Jiyang Qiu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions. Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors. This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects. In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM. By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness. Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data. Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks. This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style. We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems. <br /> <br />[Bayesian inference to improve quality of Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08901) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-12 **Authors** Dattaraj Rao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG is the most popular pattern for modern Large Language Model or LLM applications. RAG involves taking a user query and finding relevant paragraphs of context in a large corpus typically captured in a vector database. Once the first level of search happens over a vector database, the top n chunks of relevant text are included directly in the context and sent as prompt to the LLM. Problem with this approach is that quality of text chunks depends on effectiveness of search. There is no strong post processing after search to determine if the chunk does hold enough information to include in prompt. Also many times there may be chunks that have conflicting information on the same subject and the model has no prior experience which chunk to prioritize to make a decision. Often times, this leads to the model providing a statement that there are conflicting statements, and it cannot produce an answer. In this research we propose a Bayesian approach to verify the quality of text chunks from the search results. Bayes theorem tries to relate conditional probabilities of the hypothesis with evidence and prior probabilities. We propose that, finding likelihood of text chunks to give a quality answer and using prior probability of quality of text chunks can help us improve overall quality of the responses from RAG systems. We can use the LLM itself to get a likelihood of relevance of a context paragraph. For prior probability of the text chunk, we use the page number in the documents parsed. Assumption is that that paragraphs in earlier pages have a better probability of being findings and more relevant to generalizing an answer. <br /> <br />[LPU: A Latency-Optimized and Highly Scalable Processor for Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07326) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-14 **Authors** Seungjae Moon et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The explosive arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT has fueled the globalization of large language model (LLM), which consists of billions of pretrained parameters that embodies the aspects of syntax and semantics. HyperAccel introduces latency processing unit (LPU), a latency-optimized and highly scalable processor architecture for the acceleration of LLM inference. LPU perfectly balances the memory bandwidth and compute logic with streamlined dataflow to maximize performance and efficiency. LPU is equipped with expandable synchronization link (ESL) that hides data synchronization latency between multiple LPUs. HyperDex complements LPU as an intuitive software framework to run LLM applications. LPU achieves 1.25 ms/token and 20.9 ms/token for 1.3B and 66B model, respectively, which is 2.09x and 1.37x faster than the GPU. LPU, synthesized using Samsung 4nm process, has total area of 0.824 mm2 and power consumption of 284.31 mW. LPU-based servers achieve 1.33x and 1.32x energy efficiency over NVIDIA H100 and L4 servers, respectively. <br /> <br />[A Real-Time Adaptive Multi-Stream GPU System for Online Approximate Nearest Neighborhood Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02937) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-06 **Authors** Yiping Sun et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) has played a pivotal role in modern search and recommendation systems, especially in emerging LLM applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation. There is a growing exploration into harnessing the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs to meet the substantial demands of ANNS. However, existing systems primarily focus on offline scenarios, overlooking the distinct requirements of online applications that necessitate real-time insertion of new vectors. This limitation renders such systems inefficient for real-world scenarios. Moreover, previous architectures struggled to effectively support real-time insertion due to their reliance on serial execution streams. In this paper, we introduce a novel Real-Time Adaptive Multi-Stream GPU ANNS System (RTAMS-GANNS). Our architecture achieves its objectives through three key advancements: 1) We initially examined the real-time insertion mechanisms in existing GPU ANNS systems and discovered their reliance on repetitive copying and memory allocation, which significantly hinders real-time effectiveness on GPUs. As a solution, we introduce a dynamic vector insertion algorithm based on memory blocks, which includes in-place rearrangement. 2) To enable real-time vector insertion in parallel, we introduce a multi-stream parallel execution mode, which differs from existing systems that operate serially within a single stream. Our system utilizes a dynamic resource pool, allowing multiple streams to execute concurrently without additional execution blocking. 3) Through extensive experiments and comparisons, our approach effectively handles varying QPS levels across different datasets, reducing latency by up to 40%-80%. The proposed system has also been deployed in real-world industrial search and recommendation systems, serving hundreds of millions of users daily, and has achieved good results. <br /> <br />[The Geometry of Queries: Query-Based Innovations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18044) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-25 **Authors** Eric Yang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Digital health chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly improve personal health management for chronic conditions by providing accessible and on-demand health coaching and question-answering. However, these chatbots risk providing unverified and inaccurate information because LLMs generate responses based on patterns learned from diverse internet data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can help mitigate hallucinations and inaccuracies in LLM responses by grounding it on reliable content. However, efficiently and accurately retrieving most relevant set of content for real-time user questions remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), a novel approach that pre-computes a database of potential queries from a content base using LLMs. For an incoming patient question, QB-RAG efficiently matches it against this pre-generated query database using vector search, improving alignment between user questions and the content. We establish a theoretical foundation for QB-RAG and provide a comparative analysis of existing retrieval enhancement techniques for RAG systems. Finally, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QB-RAG significantly improves the accuracy of healthcare question answering, paving the way for robust and trustworthy LLM applications in digital health. <br /> <br />[Free to play: UN Trade and Development's experience with developing its own open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16896) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-18 **Authors** Daniel Hopp et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Generative artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), have exploded in popularity and attention since the release to the public of ChatGPT's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 model in November of 2022. Due to the power of these general purpose models and their ability to communicate in natural language, they can be useful in a range of domains, including the work of official statistics and international organizations. However, with such a novel and seemingly complex technology, it can feel as if generative AI is something that happens to an organization, something that can be talked about but not understood, that can be commented on but not contributed to. Additionally, the costs of adoption and operation of proprietary solutions can be both uncertain and high, a barrier for often cost-constrained international organizations. In the face of these challenges, United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), through its Global Crisis Response Group (GCRG), has explored and developed its own open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM application. RAG makes LLMs aware of and more useful for the organization's domain and work. Developing in-house solutions comes with pros and cons, with pros including cost, flexibility, and fostering institutional knowledge. Cons include time and skill investments and gaps and application polish and power. The three libraries developed to produce the app, nlp_pipeline for document processing and statistical analysis, local_rag_llm for running a local RAG LLM, and streamlit_rag for the user interface, are publicly available on PyPI and GitHub with Dockerfiles. A fourth library, local_llm_finetune, is also available for fine-tuning existing LLMs which can then be used in the application. <br /> <br />[RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16667) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-23 **Authors** Huiyu Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot. These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called "jailbreak strategy" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes. <br /> <br />[Developing a Reliable, General-Purpose Hallucination Detection and Mitigation Service: Insights and Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15441) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-22 **Authors** Song Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Hallucination, a phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) produce output that is factually incorrect or unrelated to the input, is a major challenge for LLM applications that require accuracy and dependability. In this paper, we introduce a reliable and high-speed production system aimed at detecting and rectifying the hallucination issue within LLMs. Our system encompasses named entity recognition (NER), natural language inference (NLI), span-based detection (SBD), and an intricate decision tree-based process to reliably detect a wide range of hallucinations in LLM responses. Furthermore, our team has crafted a rewriting mechanism that maintains an optimal mix of precision, response time, and cost-effectiveness. We detail the core elements of our framework and underscore the paramount challenges tied to response time, availability, and performance metrics, which are crucial for real-world deployment of these technologies. Our extensive evaluation, utilizing offline data and live production traffic, confirms the efficacy of our proposed framework and service. <br /> <br />[Arondight: Red Teaming Large Vision Language Models with Auto-generated Multi-modal Jailbreak Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15050) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-21 **Authors** Yi Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval.

However, due to data-sharing restrictions, sectors such as healthcare and finance prefer to deploy local LLM applications using costly hardware resources. This scenario requires a balance between the effectiveness advantages of LLMs and significant financial burdens. Additionally, the rapid evolution of models increases the frequency and redundancy of benchmarking efforts. Existing benchmarking toolkits, which typically focus on effectiveness, often overlook economic considerations, making their findings less applicable to practical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce CEBench, an open-source toolkit specifically designed for multi-objective benchmarking that focuses on the critical trade-offs between expenditure and effectiveness required for LLM deployments. CEBench allows for easy modifications through configuration files, enabling stakeholders to effectively assess and optimize these trade-offs. This strategic capability supports crucial decision-making processes aimed at maximizing effectiveness while minimizing cost impacts. By streamlining the evaluation process and emphasizing cost-effectiveness, CEBench seeks to facilitate the development of economically viable AI solutions across various industries and research fields. The code and demonstration are available in \url{https://github.com/amademicnoboday12/CEBench}. <br /> <br />[The Life Cycle of Large Language Models: A Review of Biases in Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11203) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-03 **Authors** Jinsook Lee et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational contexts to provide personalized support to students and teachers. The unprecedented capacity of LLM-based applications to understand and generate natural language can potentially improve instructional effectiveness and learning outcomes, but the integration of LLMs in education technology has renewed concerns over algorithmic bias which may exacerbate educational inequities. In this review, building on prior work on mapping the traditional machine learning life cycle, we provide a holistic map of the LLM life cycle from the initial development of LLMs to customizing pre-trained models for various applications in educational settings. We explain each step in the LLM life cycle and identify potential sources of bias that may arise in the context of education. We discuss why current measures of bias from traditional machine learning fail to transfer to LLM-generated content in education, such as tutoring conversations because the text is high-dimensional, there can be multiple correct responses, and tailoring responses may be pedagogically desirable rather than unfair. This review aims to clarify the complex nature of bias in LLM applications and provide practical guidance for their evaluation to promote educational equity. <br /> <br />[GraphEval: A Knowledge-Graph Based LLM Hallucination Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10793) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-15 **Authors** Hannah Sansford et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Methods to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) responses and detect inconsistencies, also known as hallucinations, with respect to the provided knowledge, are becoming increasingly important for LLM applications. Current metrics fall short in their ability to provide explainable decisions, systematically check all pieces of information in the response, and are often too computationally expensive to be used in practice. We present GraphEval: a hallucination evaluation framework based on representing information in Knowledge Graph (KG) structures. Our method identifies the specific triples in the KG that are prone to hallucinations and hence provides more insight into where in the response a hallucination has occurred, if at all, than previous methods. Furthermore, using our approach in conjunction with state-of-the-art natural language inference (NLI) models leads to an improvement in balanced accuracy on various hallucination benchmarks, compared to using the raw NLI models. Lastly, we explore the use of GraphEval for hallucination correction by leveraging the structure of the KG, a method we name GraphCorrect, and demonstrate that the majority of hallucinations can indeed be rectified. <br /> <br />[Sibyl: Simple yet Effective Agent Framework for Complex Real-world Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10718) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-16 **Authors** Yulong Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Existing agents based on large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust problem-solving capabilities by integrating LLMs' inherent knowledge, strong in-context learning and zero-shot capabilities, and the use of tools combined with intricately designed LLM invocation workflows by humans. However, these agents still exhibit shortcomings in long-term reasoning and under-use the potential of existing tools, leading to noticeable deficiencies in complex real-world reasoning scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Sibyl, a simple yet powerful LLM-based agent framework designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by efficiently leveraging a minimal set of tools. Drawing inspiration from Global Workspace Theory, Sibyl incorporates a global workspace to enhance the management and sharing of knowledge and conversation history throughout the system. Furthermore, guided by Society of Mind Theory, Sibyl implements a multi-agent debate-based jury to self-refine the final answers, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced approach. This approach aims to reduce system complexity while expanding the scope of problems solvable-from matters typically resolved by humans in minutes to those requiring hours or even days, thus facilitating a shift from System-1 to System-2 thinking. Sibyl has been designed with a focus on scalability and ease of debugging by incorporating the concept of reentrancy from functional programming from its inception, with the aim of seamless and low effort integration in other LLM applications to improve capabilities. Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark test set reveal that the Sibyl agent instantiated with GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 34.55%, compared to other agents based on GPT-4. We hope that Sibyl can inspire more reliable and reusable LLM-based agent solutions to address complex real-world reasoning tasks. <br /> <br />[FinCon: A Synthesized LLM Multi-Agent System with Conceptual Verbal Reinforcement for Enhanced Financial Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06567) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-10 **Authors** Yangyang Yu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in conducting complex tasks and are increasingly utilized in various financial applications. However, high-quality sequential financial investment decision-making remains challenging. These tasks require multiple interactions with a volatile environment for every decision, demanding sufficient intelligence to maximize returns and manage risks. Although LLMs have been used to develop agent systems that surpass human teams and yield impressive investment returns, opportunities to enhance multi-sourced information synthesis and optimize decision-making outcomes through timely experience refinement remain unexplored. Here, we introduce the FinCon, an LLM-based multi-agent framework with CONceptual verbal reinforcement tailored for diverse FINancial tasks. Inspired by effective real-world investment firm organizational structures, FinCon utilizes a manager-analyst communication hierarchy. This structure allows for synchronized cross-functional agent collaboration towards unified goals through natural language interactions and equips each agent with greater memory capacity than humans. Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs. The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent's behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs. Moreover, FinCon demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various financial tasks, including single stock trading and portfolio management. <br /> <br />[ElecBench: a Power Dispatch Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05365) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-11 **Authors** Xiyuan Zhou et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In response to the urgent demand for grid stability and the complex challenges posed by renewable energy integration and electricity market dynamics, the power sector increasingly seeks innovative technological solutions. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have become a key technology to improve efficiency and promote intelligent progress in the power sector with their excellent natural language processing, logical reasoning, and generalization capabilities. Despite their potential, the absence of a performance evaluation benchmark for LLM in the power sector has limited the effective application of these technologies. Addressing this gap, our study introduces "ElecBench", an evaluation benchmark of LLMs within the power sector. ElecBench aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing evaluation benchmarks by providing comprehensive coverage of sector-specific scenarios, deepening the testing of professional knowledge, and enhancing decision-making precision. The framework categorizes scenarios into general knowledge and professional business, further divided into six core performance metrics: factuality, logicality, stability, security, fairness, and expressiveness, and is subdivided into 24 sub-metrics, offering profound insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLM applications in the power sector. To ensure transparency, we have made the complete test set public, evaluating the performance of eight LLMs across various scenarios and metrics. ElecBench aspires to serve as the standard benchmark for LLM applications in the power sector, supporting continuous updates of scenarios, metrics, and models to drive technological progress and application. <br /> <br />[Teola: Towards End-to-End Optimization of LLM-based Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00326) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-29 **Authors** Xin Tan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language model (LLM)-based applications consist of both LLM and non-LLM components, each contributing to the end-to-end latency. Despite great efforts to optimize LLM inference, end-to-end workflow optimization has been overlooked. Existing frameworks employ coarse-grained orchestration with task modules, which confines optimizations to within each module and yields suboptimal scheduling decisions. We propose fine-grained end-to-end orchestration, which utilizes task primitives as the basic units and represents each query's workflow as a primitive-level dataflow graph. This explicitly exposes a much larger design space, enables optimizations in parallelization and pipelining across primitives of different modules, and enhances scheduling to improve application-level performance. We build Teola, a novel orchestration framework for LLM-based applications that implements this scheme. Comprehensive experiments show that Teola can achieve up to 2.09x speedup over existing systems across various popular LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Knowledge Distillation in Automated Annotation: Supervised Text Classification with LLM-Generated Training Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17633) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-25 **Authors** Nicholas Pangakis et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Computational social science (CSS) practitioners often rely on human-labeled data to fine-tune supervised text classifiers. We assess the potential for researchers to augment or replace human-generated training data with surrogate training labels from generative large language models (LLMs). We introduce a recommended workflow and test this LLM application by replicating 14 classification tasks and measuring performance. We employ a novel corpus of English-language text classification data sets from recent CSS articles in high-impact journals. Because these data sets are stored in password-protected archives, our analyses are less prone to issues of contamination. For each task, we compare supervised classifiers fine-tuned using GPT-4 labels against classifiers fine-tuned with human annotations and against labels from GPT-4 and Mistral-7B with few-shot in-context learning. Our findings indicate that supervised classification models fine-tuned on LLM-generated labels perform comparably to models fine-tuned with labels from human annotators. Fine-tuning models using LLM-generated labels can be a fast, efficient and cost-effective method of building supervised text classifiers. <br /> <br />[Serial Position Effects of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15981) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-23 **Authors** Xiaobo Guo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in zero-shot learning applications, generating responses to queries using only pre-training information without the need for additional fine-tuning. This represents a significant departure from traditional machine learning approaches. Previous research has indicated that LLMs may exhibit serial position effects, such as primacy and recency biases, which are well-documented cognitive biases in human psychology. Our extensive testing across various tasks and models confirms the widespread occurrence of these effects, although their intensity varies. We also discovered that while carefully designed prompts can somewhat mitigate these biases, their effectiveness is inconsistent. These findings underscore the significance of serial position effects during the inference process, particularly in scenarios where there are no ground truth labels, highlighting the need for greater focus on addressing these effects in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[GIEBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Group Identity-based Empathy for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14903) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-24 **Authors** Leyan Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) continue to develop and gain widespread application, the ability of LLMs to exhibit empathy towards diverse group identities and understand their perspectives is increasingly recognized as critical. Most existing benchmarks for empathy evaluation of LLMs focus primarily on universal human emotions, such as sadness and pain, often overlooking the context of individuals' group identities. To address this gap, we introduce GIEBench, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 11 identity dimensions, covering 97 group identities with a total of 999 single-choice questions related to specific group identities. GIEBench is designed to evaluate the empathy of LLMs when presented with specific group identities such as gender, age, occupation, and race, emphasizing their ability to respond from the standpoint of the identified group. This supports the ongoing development of empathetic LLM applications tailored to users with different identities. Our evaluation of 23 LLMs revealed that while these LLMs understand different identity standpoints, they fail to consistently exhibit equal empathy across these identities without explicit instructions to adopt those perspectives. This highlights the need for improved alignment of LLMs with diverse values to better accommodate the multifaceted nature of human identities. Our datasets are available at https://github.com/GIEBench/GIEBench. <br /> <br />[The Fire Thief Is Also the Keeper: Balancing Usability and Privacy in Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14318) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-20 **Authors** Zhili Shen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid adoption of online chatbots represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence. However, this convenience brings considerable privacy concerns, as prompts can inadvertently contain sensitive information exposed to large language models (LLMs). Limited by high computational costs, reduced task usability, and excessive system modifications, previous works based on local deployment, embedding perturbation, and homomorphic encryption are inapplicable to online prompt-based LLM applications.   To address these issues, this paper introduces Prompt Privacy Sanitizer (i.e., ProSan), an end-to-end prompt privacy protection framework that can produce anonymized prompts with contextual privacy removed while maintaining task usability and human readability. It can also be seamlessly integrated into the online LLM service pipeline. To achieve high usability and dynamic anonymity, ProSan flexibly adjusts its protection targets and strength based on the importance of the words and the privacy leakage risk of the prompts. Additionally, ProSan is capable of adapting to diverse computational resource conditions, ensuring privacy protection even for mobile devices with limited computing power. Our experiments demonstrate that ProSan effectively removes private information across various tasks, including question answering, text summarization, and code generation, with minimal reduction in task performance. <br /> <br />[ReaLHF: Optimized RLHF Training for Large Language Models through Parameter Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14088) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-20 **Authors** Zhiyu Mei et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) stands as a pivotal technique in empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Since RLHF involves diverse computational workloads and intricate dependencies among multiple LLMs, directly adopting parallelization techniques from supervised training can result in sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically redistributes LLM parameters in the cluster and adapts parallelization strategies during training. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaLHF, a pioneering system capable of automatically discovering and running efficient execution plans for RLHF training given the desired algorithmic and hardware configurations. ReaLHF formulates the execution plan for RLHF as an augmented dataflow graph. Based on this formulation, ReaLHF employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight cost estimator to discover an efficient execution plan. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaLHF on the LLaMA-2 models with up to $4\times70$ billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experiment results showcase ReaLHF's substantial speedups of $2.0-10.6\times$ compared to baselines. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaLHF exhibit an average of $26\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM. The source code of ReaLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF . <br /> <br />[Fine-Tuning or Fine-Failing? Debunking Performance Myths in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11201) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-30 **Authors** Scott Barnett et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have the unique capability to understand and generate human-like text from input queries. When fine-tuned, these models show enhanced performance on domain-specific queries. OpenAI highlights the process of fine-tuning, stating: "To fine-tune a model, you are required to provide at least 10 examples. We typically see clear improvements from fine-tuning on 50 to 100 training examples, but the right number varies greatly based on the exact use case." This study extends this concept to the integration of LLMs within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, which aim to improve accuracy and relevance by leveraging external corpus data for information retrieval. However, RAG's promise of delivering optimal responses often falls short in complex query scenarios. This study aims to specifically examine the effects of fine-tuning LLMs on their ability to extract and integrate contextual data to enhance the performance of RAG systems across multiple domains. We evaluate the impact of fine-tuning on the LLMs' capacity for data extraction and contextual understanding by comparing the accuracy and completeness of fine-tuned models against baseline performances across datasets from multiple domains. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning resulted in a decline in performance compared to the baseline models, contrary to the improvements observed in standalone LLM applications as suggested by OpenAI. This study highlights the need for vigorous investigation and validation of fine-tuned models for domain-specific tasks. <br /> <br />[A Training-free Sub-quadratic Cost Transformer Model Serving Framework With Hierarchically Pruned Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09827) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-15 **Authors** Heejun Lee et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible. <br /> <br />[Decoding the Diversity: A Review of the Indic AI Research Landscape](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09559) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-13 **Authors** Sankalp KJ et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of large language model (LLM) research directions within Indic languages. Indic languages are those spoken in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan, among others. These languages have a rich cultural and linguistic heritage and are spoken by over 1.5 billion people worldwide. With the tremendous market potential and growing demand for natural language processing (NLP) based applications in diverse languages, generative applications for Indic languages pose unique challenges and opportunities for research. Our paper deep dives into the recent advancements in Indic generative modeling, contributing with a taxonomy of research directions, tabulating 84 recent publications. Research directions surveyed in this paper include LLM development, fine-tuning existing LLMs, development of corpora, benchmarking and evaluation, as well as publications around specific techniques, tools, and applications. We found that researchers across the publications emphasize the challenges associated with limited data availability, lack of standardization, and the peculiar linguistic complexities of Indic languages. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the field of NLP, particularly those focused on Indic languages, and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient LLM applications for these languages. <br /> <br />[CS-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Large Language Models towards Computer Science Mastery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08587) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-12 **Authors** Xiaoshuai Song et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Computer Science (CS) stands as a testament to the intricacies of human intelligence, profoundly advancing the development of artificial intelligence and modern society. However, the current community of large language models (LLMs) overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first bilingual (Chinese-English) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 5K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities. The CS-Bench data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/csbench/csbench. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Medical Large Language Models: Technology, Application, Trustworthiness, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03712) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-06 **Authors** Lei Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT series models, have received substantial attention due to their impressive capabilities for generating and understanding human-level language. More recently, LLMs have emerged as an innovative and powerful adjunct in the medical field, transforming traditional practices and heralding a new era of enhanced healthcare services. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Medical Large Language Models (Med-LLMs), outlining their evolution from general to the medical-specific domain (i.e, Technology and Application), as well as their transformative impact on healthcare (e.g., Trustworthiness and Safety). Concretely, starting from the fundamental history and technology of LLMs, we first delve into the progressive adaptation and refinements of general LLM models in the medical domain, especially emphasizing the advanced algorithms that boost the LLMs' performance in handling complicated medical environments, including clinical reasoning, knowledge graph, retrieval-augmented generation, human alignment, and multi-modal learning. Secondly, we explore the extensive applications of Med-LLMs across domains such as clinical decision support, report generation, and medical education, illustrating their potential to streamline healthcare services and augment patient outcomes. Finally, recognizing the imperative and responsible innovation, we discuss the challenges of ensuring fairness, accountability, privacy, and robustness in Med-LLMs applications. Finally, we conduct a concise discussion for anticipating possible future trajectories of Med-LLMs, identifying avenues for the prudent expansion of Med-LLMs. By consolidating above-mentioned insights, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive investigation of the potential strengths and limitations of Med-LLMs for professionals and researchers, ensuring a responsible landscape in the healthcare setting. <br /> <br />[The Challenges of Evaluating LLM Applications: An Analysis of Automated, Human, and LLM-Based Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03339) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-13 **Authors** Bhashithe Abeysinghe et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Chatbots have been an interesting application of natural language generation since its inception. With novel transformer based Generative AI methods, building chatbots have become trivial. Chatbots which are targeted at specific domains for example medicine and psychology are implemented rapidly. This however, should not distract from the need to evaluate the chatbot responses. Especially because the natural language generation community does not entirely agree upon how to effectively evaluate such applications. With this work we discuss the issue further with the increasingly popular LLM based evaluations and how they correlate with human evaluations. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive factored evaluation mechanism that can be utilized in conjunction with both human and LLM-based evaluations. We present the results of an experimental evaluation conducted using this scheme in one of our chatbot implementations which consumed educational reports, and subsequently compare automated, traditional human evaluation, factored human evaluation, and factored LLM evaluation. Results show that factor based evaluation produces better insights on which aspects need to be improved in LLM applications and further strengthens the argument to use human evaluation in critical spaces where main functionality is not direct retrieval. <br /> <br />[Unveiling Selection Biases: Exploring Order and Token Sensitivity in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03009) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Sheng-Lun Wei et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of "selection biases" in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on problems where models are tasked with choosing the optimal option from an ordered sequence. We delve into biases related to option order and token usage, which significantly impact LLMs' decision-making processes. We also quantify the impact of these biases through an extensive empirical analysis across multiple models and tasks. Furthermore, we propose mitigation strategies to enhance model performance. Our key contributions are threefold: 1) Precisely quantifying the influence of option order and token on LLMs, 2) Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of token and order sensitivity to enhance robustness, and 3) Offering a detailed analysis of sensitivity across models and tasks, which informs the creation of more stable and reliable LLM applications for selection problems. <br /> <br />[Recent advances in text embedding: A Comprehensive Review of Top-Performing Methods on the MTEB Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01607) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-19 **Authors** Hongliu Cao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Text embedding methods have become increasingly popular in both industrial and academic fields due to their critical role in a variety of natural language processing tasks. The significance of universal text embeddings has been further highlighted with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Systems (RAGs). While previous models have attempted to be general-purpose, they often struggle to generalize across tasks and domains. However, recent advancements in training data quantity, quality and diversity; synthetic data generation from LLMs as well as using LLMs as backbones encourage great improvements in pursuing universal text embeddings. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances in universal text embedding models with a focus on the top performing text embeddings on Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). Through detailed comparison and analysis, we highlight the key contributions and limitations in this area, and propose potentially inspiring future research directions. <br /> <br />[Luna: An Evaluation Foundation Model to Catch Language Model Hallucinations with High Accuracy and Low Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00975) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Masha Belyi et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of language models by incorporating external knowledge retrieval mechanisms. However, a significant challenge in deploying these systems in industry applications is the detection and mitigation of hallucinations: instances where the model generates information that is not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) in diverse industry settings. Current hallucination detection techniques fail to deliver accuracy, low latency, and low cost simultaneously. We introduce Luna: a DeBERTA-large (440M) encoder, finetuned for hallucination detection in RAG settings. We demonstrate that Luna outperforms GPT-3.5 and commercial evaluation frameworks on the hallucination detection task, with 97% and 91% reduction in cost and latency, respectively. Luna is lightweight and generalizes across multiple industry verticals and out-of-domain data, making it an ideal candidate for industry LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Parrot: Efficient Serving of LLM-based Applications with Semantic Variable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19888) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-30 **Authors** Chaofan Lin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled LLM-based applications (a.k.a. AI agents or co-pilots), a new software paradigm that combines the strength of LLM and conventional software. Diverse LLM applications from different tenants could design complex workflows using multiple LLM requests to accomplish one task. However, they have to use the over-simplified request-level API provided by today's public LLM services, losing essential application-level information. Public LLM services have to blindly optimize individual LLM requests, leading to sub-optimal end-to-end performance of LLM applications.   This paper introduces Parrot, an LLM service system that focuses on the end-to-end experience of LLM-based applications. Parrot proposes Semantic Variable, a unified abstraction to expose application-level knowledge to public LLM services. A Semantic Variable annotates an input/output variable in the prompt of a request, and creates the data pipeline when connecting multiple LLM requests, providing a natural way to program LLM applications. Exposing Semantic Variables to the public LLM service allows it to perform conventional data flow analysis to uncover the correlation across multiple LLM requests. This correlation opens a brand-new optimization space for the end-to-end performance of LLM-based applications. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Parrot can achieve up to an order-of-magnitude improvement for popular and practical use cases of LLM applications. <br /> <br />[LLMs achieve adult human performance on higher-order theory of mind tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18870) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-31 **Authors** Winnie Street et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have developed higher-order theory of mind (ToM); the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g. I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite -- Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&A -- and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for the realisation of ToM abilities, and that the best-performing LLMs have developed a generalised capacity for ToM. Given the role that higher-order ToM plays in a wide range of cooperative and competitive human behaviours, these findings have significant implications for user-facing LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Towards Integrating Emerging AI Applications in SE Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18062) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-03 **Authors** Michael Vierhauser et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have been incorporated into modern learning environments and software engineering (SE) courses and curricula for several years. However, with the significant rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) in general, and OpenAI's LLM-powered chatbot ChatGPT in particular in the last year, educators are faced with rapidly changing classroom environments and disrupted teaching principles. Examples range from programming assignment solutions that are fully generated via ChatGPT, to various forms of cheating during exams. However, despite these negative aspects and emerging challenges, AI tools in general, and LLM applications in particular, can also provide significant opportunities in a wide variety of SE courses, supporting both students and educators in meaningful ways. In this early research paper, we present preliminary results of a systematic analysis of current trends in the area of AI, and how they can be integrated into university-level SE curricula, guidelines, and approaches to support both instructors and learners. We collected both teaching and research papers and analyzed their potential usage in SE education, using the ACM Computer Science Curriculum Guidelines CS2023. As an initial outcome, we discuss a series of opportunities for AI applications and further research areas. <br /> <br />[STRIDE: A Tool-Assisted LLM Agent Framework for Strategic and Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16376) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-28 **Authors** Chuanhao Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized natural language processing, showing remarkable linguistic proficiency and reasoning capabilities. However, their application in strategic multi-agent decision-making environments is hampered by significant limitations including poor mathematical reasoning, difficulty in following instructions, and a tendency to generate incorrect information. These deficiencies hinder their performance in strategic and interactive tasks that demand adherence to nuanced game rules, long-term planning, exploration in unknown environments, and anticipation of opponents' moves. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a novel LLM agent framework equipped with memory and specialized tools to enhance their strategic decision-making capabilities. We deploy the tools in a number of economically important environments, in particular bilateral bargaining and multi-agent and dynamic mechanism design. We employ quantitative metrics to assess the framework's performance in various strategic decision-making problems. Our findings establish that our enhanced framework significantly improves the strategic decision-making capability of LLMs. While we highlight the inherent limitations of current LLM models, we demonstrate the improvements through targeted enhancements, suggesting a promising direction for future developments in LLM applications for interactive environments. <br /> <br />[Assessing Political Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13041) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Luca Rettenberger et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The assessment of bias within Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical concern in the contemporary discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of their potential impact on societal dynamics. Recognizing and considering political bias within LLM applications is especially important when closing in on the tipping point toward performative prediction. Then, being educated about potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can drive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In this way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political bias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct or assistant models) concerning political issues within the European Union (EU) from a German voter's perspective. To do so, we use the "Wahl-O-Mat," a voting advice application used in Germany. From the voting advice of the "Wahl-O-Mat" we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with German political parties. We show that larger models, such as Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties, while smaller models often remain neutral, particularly when prompted in English. The central finding is that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in the alignment concerning a specific party. Our findings underline the importance of rigorously assessing and making bias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities of performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine learning prediction and language generation. <br /> <br />[Generative AI and Large Language Models for Cyber Security: All Insights You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12750) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-21 **Authors** Mohamed Amine Ferrag et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats. <br /> <br />[PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06823) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-14 **Authors** Bo Hui et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a new ecosystem with many downstream applications, called LLM applications, with different natural language processing tasks. The functionality and performance of an LLM application highly depend on its system prompt, which instructs the backend LLM on what task to perform. Therefore, an LLM application developer often keeps a system prompt confidential to protect its intellectual property. As a result, a natural attack, called prompt leaking, is to steal the system prompt from an LLM application, which compromises the developer's intellectual property. Existing prompt leaking attacks primarily rely on manually crafted queries, and thus achieve limited effectiveness.   In this paper, we design a novel, closed-box prompt leaking attack framework, called PLeak, to optimize an adversarial query such that when the attacker sends it to a target LLM application, its response reveals its own system prompt. We formulate finding such an adversarial query as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method approximately. Our key idea is to break down the optimization goal by optimizing adversary queries for system prompts incrementally, i.e., starting from the first few tokens of each system prompt step by step until the entire length of the system prompt.   We evaluate PLeak in both offline settings and for real-world LLM applications, e.g., those on Poe, a popular platform hosting such applications. Our results show that PLeak can effectively leak system prompts and significantly outperforms not only baselines that manually curate queries but also baselines with optimized queries that are modified and adapted from existing jailbreaking attacks. We responsibly reported the issues to Poe and are still waiting for their response. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/BHui97/PLeak. <br /> <br />[XAI4LLM. Let Machine Learning Models and LLMs Collaborate for Enhanced In-Context Learning in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06270) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-03 **Authors** Fatemeh Nazary et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare diagnostics offers a promising avenue for clinical decision-making. This study outlines the development of a novel method for zero-shot/few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by integrating medical domain knowledge using a multi-layered structured prompt. We also explore the efficacy of two communication styles between the user and LLMs: the Numerical Conversational (NC) style, which processes data incrementally, and the Natural Language Single-Turn (NL-ST) style, which employs long narrative prompts.   Our study systematically evaluates the diagnostic accuracy and risk factors, including gender bias and false negative rates, using a dataset of 920 patient records in various few-shot scenarios. Results indicate that traditional clinical machine learning (ML) models generally outperform LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. However, the performance gap narrows significantly when employing few-shot examples alongside effective explainable AI (XAI) methods as sources of domain knowledge. Moreover, with sufficient time and an increased number of examples, the conversational style (NC) nearly matches the performance of ML models. Most notably, LLMs demonstrate comparable or superior cost-sensitive accuracy relative to ML models.   This research confirms that, with appropriate domain knowledge and tailored communication strategies, LLMs can significantly enhance diagnostic processes. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of training examples and communication styles to improve accuracy and reduce biases in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Risks of Practicing Large Language Models in Smart Grid: Threat Modeling and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06237) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-10 **Authors** Jiangnan Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Model (LLM) is a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) and holds considerable potential for application within smart grids. However, as demonstrated in previous literature, AI technologies are susceptible to various types of attacks. It is crucial to investigate and evaluate the risks associated with LLMs before deploying them in critical infrastructure like smart grids. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of LLMs and identify two major types of attacks relevant to smart grid LLM applications, along with presenting the corresponding threat models. We then validate these attacks using popular LLMs, utilizing real smart grid data. Our validation demonstrates that attackers are capable of injecting bad data and retrieving domain knowledge from LLMs employed in smart grid scenarios. <br /> <br />[A Fourth Wave of Open Data? Exploring the Spectrum of Scenarios for Open Data and Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04333) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-07 **Authors** Hannah Chafetz et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Since late 2022, generative AI has taken the world by storm, with widespread use of tools including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Generative AI and large language model (LLM) applications are transforming how individuals find and access data and knowledge. However, the intricate relationship between open data and generative AI, and the vast potential it holds for driving innovation in this field remain underexplored areas. This white paper seeks to unpack the relationship between open data and generative AI and explore possible components of a new Fourth Wave of Open Data: Is open data becoming AI ready? Is open data moving towards a data commons approach? Is generative AI making open data more conversational? Will generative AI improve open data quality and provenance? Towards this end, we provide a new Spectrum of Scenarios framework. This framework outlines a range of scenarios in which open data and generative AI could intersect and what is required from a data quality and provenance perspective to make open data ready for those specific scenarios. These scenarios include: pertaining, adaptation, inference and insight generation, data augmentation, and open-ended exploration. Through this process, we found that in order for data holders to embrace generative AI to improve open data access and develop greater insights from open data, they first must make progress around five key areas: enhance transparency and documentation, uphold quality and integrity, promote interoperability and standards, improve accessibility and useability, and address ethical considerations. <br /> <br />[When LLMs Meet Cybersecurity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03644) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-06 **Authors** Jie Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an ever-evolving threat landscape and need for innovative technologies.

Therefore, there is a demand for new, flexible, and effective metrics. In this study, we introduce RepEval, the first metric leveraging the projection of LLM representations for evaluation. RepEval requires minimal sample pairs for training, and through simple prompt modifications, it can easily transition to various tasks. Results on ten datasets from three tasks demonstrate the high effectiveness of our method, which exhibits stronger correlations with human judgments compared to previous metrics, even outperforming GPT-4. Our work underscores the richness of information regarding text quality embedded within LLM representations, offering insights for the development of new metrics. <br /> <br />[Generating Situated Reflection Triggers about Alternative Solution Paths: A Case Study of Generative AI for Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18262) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-28 **Authors** Atharva Naik et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> An advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their contextualization capability - providing different responses based on student inputs like solution strategy or prior discussion, to potentially better engage students than standard feedback. We present a design and evaluation of a proof-of-concept LLM application to offer students dynamic and contextualized feedback. Specifically, we augment an Online Programming Exercise bot for a college-level Cloud Computing course with ChatGPT, which offers students contextualized reflection triggers during a collaborative query optimization task in database design. We demonstrate that LLMs can be used to generate highly situated reflection triggers that incorporate details of the collaborative discussion happening in context. We discuss in depth the exploration of the design space of the triggers and their correspondence with the learning objectives as well as the impact on student learning in a pilot study with 34 students. <br /> <br />[Human-Imperceptible Retrieval Poisoning Attacks in LLM-Powered Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17196) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-26 **Authors** Quan Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Presently, with the assistance of advanced LLM application development frameworks, more and more LLM-powered applications can effortlessly augment the LLMs' knowledge with external content using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, these frameworks' designs do not have sufficient consideration of the risk of external content, thereby allowing attackers to undermine the applications developed with these frameworks. In this paper, we reveal a new threat to LLM-powered applications, termed retrieval poisoning, where attackers can guide the application to yield malicious responses during the RAG process. Specifically, through the analysis of LLM application frameworks, attackers can craft documents visually indistinguishable from benign ones. Despite the documents providing correct information, once they are used as reference sources for RAG, the application is misled into generating incorrect responses. Our preliminary experiments indicate that attackers can mislead LLMs with an 88.33\% success rate, and achieve a 66.67\% success rate in the real-world application, demonstrating the potential impact of retrieval poisoning. <br /> <br />[Prompt Leakage effect and defense strategies for multi-turn LLM interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16251) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-29 **Authors** Divyansh Agarwal et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompt leakage poses a compelling security and privacy threat in LLM applications. Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property, and act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation of prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for multi-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs, across four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM sycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7% to 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows dissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and knowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense strategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against leakage attempts. We present different combination of defenses against our threat model, including a cost analysis.

Patil et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving beyond their classical role of providing information within dialogue systems to actively engaging with tools and performing actions on real-world applications and services. Today, humans verify the correctness and appropriateness of the LLM-generated outputs (e.g., code, functions, or actions) before putting them into real-world execution. This poses significant challenges as code comprehension is well known to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, we study how humans can efficiently collaborate with, delegate to, and supervise autonomous LLMs in the future. We argue that in many cases, "post-facto validation" - verifying the correctness of a proposed action after seeing the output - is much easier than the aforementioned "pre-facto validation" setting. The core concept behind enabling a post-facto validation system is the integration of an intuitive undo feature, and establishing a damage confinement for the LLM-generated actions as effective strategies to mitigate the associated risks. Using this, a human can now either revert the effect of an LLM-generated output or be confident that the potential risk is bounded. We believe this is critical to unlock the potential for LLM agents to interact with applications and services with limited (post-facto) human involvement. We describe the design and implementation of our open-source runtime for executing LLM actions, Gorilla Execution Engine (GoEX), and present open research questions towards realizing the goal of LLMs and applications interacting with each other with minimal human supervision. We release GoEX at https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/. <br /> <br />[Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-18 **Authors** Cangqing Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inaugurated a transformative epoch in natural language processing, fostering unprecedented proficiency in text generation, comprehension, and contextual scrutiny. Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models' context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs' efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions. <br /> <br />[Towards Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-03 **Authors** Xusen Guo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow Prediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable traffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive and reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of traffic flows. <br /> <br />[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-27 **Authors** Tobias Schnabel et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed.   We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo . <br /> <br />[Large Language Models in Biomedical and Health Informatics: A Review with Bibliometric Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16303) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-28 **Authors** Huizi Yu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research.

Large language models (LLMs) have been proven to assist in creative tasks, yet much controversy exists regarding their role in fostering creativity. This paper explores the potential of LLMs in PBL settings, with a special focus on fostering creativity. We began with an exploratory study involving 12 middle school students and identified five design considerations for LLM applications in PBL. Building on this, we developed an LLM-empowered, 48-hour PBL program and conducted an instructional experiment with 31 middle school students. Our results indicated that LLMs can enhance every stage of PBL. Additionally, we also discovered ambivalent perspectives among students and mentors toward LLM usage. Furthermore, we explored the challenge and design implications of integrating LLMs into PBL and reflected on the program. By bridging AI advancements into educational practice, our work aims to inspire further discourse and investigation into harnessing AI's potential in child-centric educational settings. <br /> <br />[The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14814) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-01 **Authors** Hannah R. Lawrence et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-11 **Authors** Zheyuan He et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools across various domains within cyber security. Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS).   Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns. Our thorough review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks of tasks on LLM4BS, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike. <br /> <br />[Breaking the Language Barrier: Can Direct Inference Outperform Pre-Translation in Multilingual LLM Applications?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04792) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-04 **Authors** Yotam Intrator et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models hold significant promise in multilingual applications. However, inherent biases stemming from predominantly English-centric pre-training have led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating non-English inputs to English before inference, leading to complexity and information loss. This study re-evaluates the need for pre-translation in the context of PaLM2 models (Anil et al., 2023), which have been established as highly performant in multilingual tasks. We offer a comprehensive investigation across 108 languages and 6 diverse benchmarks, including open-end generative tasks, which were excluded from previous similar studies. Our findings challenge the pre-translation paradigm established in prior research, highlighting the advantages of direct inference in PaLM2. Specifically, PaLM2-L consistently outperforms pre-translation in 94 out of 108 languages. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective multilingual applications, alleviating the limitations associated with pre-translation and unlocking linguistic authenticity. <br /> <br />[Do Large Language Model Understand Multi-Intent Spoken Language ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04481) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-15 **Authors** Shangjian Yin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This research signifies a considerable breakthrough in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU). Our approach re-imagines the use of entity slots in multi-intent SLU applications, making the most of the generative potential of LLMs within the SLU landscape, leading to the development of the EN-LLM series. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of Sub-Intent Instruction (SII) to amplify the analysis and interpretation of complex, multi-intent communications, which further supports the creation of the ENSI-LLM models series. Our novel datasets, identified as LM-MixATIS and LM-MixSNIPS, are synthesized from existing benchmarks. The study evidences that LLMs may match or even surpass the performance of the current best multi-intent SLU models. We also scrutinize the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of intent configurations and dataset distributions. On top of this, we present two revolutionary metrics - Entity Slot Accuracy (ESA) and Combined Semantic Accuracy (CSA) - to facilitate a detailed assessment of LLM competence in this multifaceted field." Our code and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/SJY8460/SLM}. <br /> <br />[SciAssess: Benchmarking LLM Proficiency in Scientific Literature Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01976) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-18 **Authors** Hengxing Cai et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized scientific literature analysis. However, existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in this domain, particularly in scenarios requiring higher-level abilities beyond mere memorization and the handling of multimodal data. In response to this gap, we introduce SciAssess, a benchmark specifically designed for the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in scientific literature analysis. It aims to thoroughly assess the efficacy of LLMs by evaluating their capabilities in Memorization (L1), Comprehension (L2), and Analysis \& Reasoning (L3). It encompasses a variety of tasks drawn from diverse scientific fields, including biology, chemistry, material, and medicine. To ensure the reliability of SciAssess, rigorous quality control measures have been implemented, ensuring accuracy, anonymization, and compliance with copyright standards. SciAssess evaluates 11 LLMs, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. We hope this evaluation supports the ongoing development of LLM applications in scientific literature analysis. SciAssess and its resources are available at \url{https://github.com/sci-assess/SciAssess}. <br /> <br />[Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01749) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-23 **Authors** Chulin Xie et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine learning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data generated in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a promising and scalable solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP finetuning of large language models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational resources for open-source LLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to diffusion models. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE, that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and generate DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP finetuning baselines. This underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of LLMs to produce high-quality DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving LLM applications. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI-secure/aug-pe. <br /> <br />[SERVAL: Synergy Learning between Vertical Models and LLMs towards Oracle-Level Zero-shot Medical Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01570) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-16 **Authors** Jiahuan Yan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has exhibited impressive zero-shot proficiency on generic and common sense questions. However, LLMs' application on domain-specific vertical questions still lags behind, primarily due to the humiliation problems and deficiencies in vertical knowledge. Furthermore, the vertical data annotation process often requires labor-intensive expert involvement, thereby presenting an additional challenge in enhancing the model's vertical capabilities. In this paper, we propose SERVAL, a synergy learning pipeline designed for unsupervised development of vertical capabilities in both LLMs and small models by mutual enhancement. Specifically, SERVAL utilizes the LLM's zero-shot outputs as annotations, leveraging its confidence to teach a robust vertical model from scratch. Reversely, the trained vertical model guides the LLM fine-tuning to enhance its zero-shot capability, progressively improving both models through an iterative process. In medical domain, known for complex vertical knowledge and costly annotations, comprehensive experiments show that, without access to any gold labels, SERVAL with the synergy learning of OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a simple model attains fully-supervised competitive performance across ten widely used medical datasets. These datasets represent vertically specialized medical diagnostic scenarios (e.g., diabetes, heart diseases, COVID-19), highlighting the potential of SERVAL in refining the vertical capabilities of LLMs and training vertical models from scratch, all achieved without the need for annotations. <br /> <br />[AutoRD: An Automatic and End-to-End System for Rare Disease Knowledge Graph Construction Based on Ontologies-enhanced Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00953) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-01 **Authors** Lang Cao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Objectives: Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates extracting information from clinical text about rare diseases. We have conducted various tests to evaluate the performance of AutoRD and highlighted its strengths and limitations in this paper.   Materials and Methods: Our system, AutoRD, is a software pipeline involving data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implement this using large language models and medical knowledge graphs developed from open-source medical ontologies. We quantitatively evaluate our system on entity extraction, relation extraction, and the performance of knowledge graph construction.   Results: AutoRD achieves an overall F1 score of 47.3%, a 14.4% improvement compared to the base LLM. In detail, AutoRD achieves an overall entity extraction F1 score of 56.1% (rare_disease: 83.5%, disease: 35.8%, symptom_and_sign: 46.1%, anaphor: 67.5%) and an overall relation extraction F1 score of 38.6% (produces: 34.7%, increases_risk_of: 12.4%, is_a: 37.4%, is_acronym: 44.1%, is_synonym: 16.3%, anaphora: 57.5%). Our qualitative experiment also demonstrates that the performance in constructing the knowledge graph is commendable.   Discussion: AutoRD demonstrates the potential of LLM applications in rare disease detection. This improvement is attributed to several design, including the integration of ontologies-enhanced LLMs.   Conclusion: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs. It uses ontologies-enhanced LLMs for a robust medical knowledge base. The superior performance of AutoRD is validated by experimental evaluations, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in healthcare. <br /> <br />[TroubleLLM: Align to Red Team Expert](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00829) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-28 **Authors** Zhuoer Xu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) become the start-of-the-art solutions for a variety of natural language tasks and are integrated into real-world applications. However, LLMs can be potentially harmful in manifesting undesirable safety issues like social biases and toxic content. It is imperative to assess its safety issues before deployment. However, the quality and diversity of test prompts generated by existing methods are still far from satisfactory. Not only are these methods labor-intensive and require large budget costs, but the controllability of test prompt generation is lacking for the specific testing domain of LLM applications. With the idea of LLM for LLM testing, we propose the first LLM, called TroubleLLM, to generate controllable test prompts on LLM safety issues. Extensive experiments and human evaluation illustrate the superiority of TroubleLLM on generation quality and generation controllability. <br /> <br />[LLMGuard: Guarding Against Unsafe LLM Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00826) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-27 **Authors** Shubh Goyal et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Although the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise settings brings new opportunities and capabilities, it also brings challenges, such as the risk of generating inappropriate, biased, or misleading content that violates regulations and can have legal concerns. To alleviate this, we present "LLMGuard", a tool that monitors user interactions with an LLM application and flags content against specific behaviours or conversation topics. To do this robustly, LLMGuard employs an ensemble of detectors. <br /> <br />[PRSA: PRompt Stealing Attacks against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-08 **Authors** Yong Yang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In recent years, "prompt as a service" has greatly enhanced the utility of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to perform various downstream tasks efficiently without fine-tuning. This has also increased the commercial value of prompts. However, the potential risk of leakage in these commercialized prompts remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack framework, PRSA, designed for prompt stealing attacks against LLMs. The main idea of PRSA is to infer the intent behind a prompt by analyzing its input-output content, enabling the generation of a surrogate prompt that replicates the original's functionality. Specifically, PRSA mainly consists of two key phases: prompt mutation and prompt pruning. In the mutation phase, we propose a prompt attention algorithm based on output difference. The algorithm facilitates the generation of effective surrogate prompts by learning key factors that influence the accurate inference of prompt intent. During the pruning phase, we employ a two-step related word identification strategy to detect and mask words that are highly related to the input, thus improving the generalizability of the surrogate prompts. We verify the actual threat of PRSA through evaluation in both real-world settings, non-interactive and interactive prompt services. The results strongly confirm the PRSA's effectiveness and generalizability. We have reported these findings to prompt service providers and actively collaborate with them to implement defensive measures. <br /> <br />[Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Paul Röttger et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for Personal Mobility Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-27 **Authors** Jiawei Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and effective personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by effectively processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. We evaluate our LLM agent framework and compare it with state-of-the-art personal mobility generation approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its potential applications in urban mobility. Overall, this study marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis. <br /> <br />[An Evaluation of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13714) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-21 **Authors** Hengchuang Yin et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have gained considerable interest across diverse research communities. Their notable ability for text completion and generation has inaugurated a novel paradigm for language-interfaced problem solving. However, the potential and efficacy of these models in bioinformatics remain incompletely explored. In this work, we study the performance LLMs on a wide spectrum of crucial bioinformatics tasks. These tasks include the identification of potential coding regions, extraction of named entities for genes and proteins, detection of antimicrobial and anti-cancer peptides, molecular optimization, and resolution of educational bioinformatics problems. Our findings indicate that, given appropriate prompts, LLMs like GPT variants can successfully handle most of these tasks. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of their limitations in the context of complicated bioinformatics tasks. In conclusion, we believe that this work can provide new perspectives and motivate future research in the field of LLMs applications, AI for Science and bioinformatics. <br /> <br />[Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13659) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-02 **Authors** Da Yu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user instructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with users' intentions. These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive information, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new privacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we propose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data annotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by generating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators. Crucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that matches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real ones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final set of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real instructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic instructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna. <br /> <br />[Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11571) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-18 **Authors** Zining Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging conversation. However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on scripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations. This paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models (LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations. We introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to generate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's personality. We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a text-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a library of physical actions for the robot. We develop a custom, state-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's tone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot actions. A demo of our system is available here. To illuminate design and implementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a social robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback, conducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy, helpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment. Most negative feedback was due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on conversations. However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM repeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses, that have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for LLM application. <br /> <br />[Fine-tuning Large Language Model (LLM) Artificial Intelligence Chatbots in Ophthalmology and LLM-based evaluation using GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10083) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-15 **Authors** Ting Fang Tan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician experts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient queries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology questions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent commonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and testing (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b, LLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset, additional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing dataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized clinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on clinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4 evaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical alignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest (87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%), LLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4 evaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings, with Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80 respectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50. Notably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical inaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately identified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment of GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical evaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By complementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient and automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in LLM applications for healthcare. <br /> <br />[UNDIAL: Self-Distillation with Adjusted Logits for Robust Unlearning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10052) <br /> **Date** 2024-10-16 **Authors** Yijiang River Dong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Mitigating the retention of sensitive or private information in large language models is essential for enhancing privacy and safety. Existing unlearning methods, like Gradient Ascent and Negative Preference Optimization, directly tune models to remove unwanted information. However, these methods often become unstable because they fine-tune by maximizing cross-entropy loss, which is the opposite of traditional loss minimization in learning. This reversal creates instability, especially on larger datasets, as the model struggles to balance unlearning with maintaining language capacity, leading to over-unlearning. In this paper, we introduce UnDIAL (Unlearning via Self-Distillation on Adjusted Logits), a novel and robust unlearning method. Our approach leverages self-distillation to adjust logits and selectively reduce the influence of targeted tokens. This technique ensures smooth convergence and avoids catastrophic forgetting, even in challenging unlearning tasks with large datasets and sequential unlearning requests. Extensive experiments show that UnDIAL can achieve both robustness in unlearning and scalability while maintaining stable training dynamics and resilience to hyperparameter tuning. <br /> <br />[Anchor-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07616) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-01 **Authors** Jianhui Pang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications. <br /> <br />[T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07483) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-06 **Authors** Masoomali Fatehkia et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities fueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of domains. An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations, including a Needle in a Haystack test, show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model Hallucination via a Creativity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06647) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-02 **Authors** Xuhui Jiang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are always seen as limitations. However, could they also be a source of creativity? This survey explores this possibility, suggesting that hallucinations may contribute to LLM application by fostering creativity. This survey begins with a review of the taxonomy of hallucinations and their negative impact on LLM reliability in critical applications. Then, through historical examples and recent relevant theories, the survey explores the potential creative benefits of hallucinations in LLMs. To elucidate the value and evaluation criteria of this connection, we delve into the definitions and assessment methods of creativity. Following the framework of divergent and convergent thinking phases, the survey systematically reviews the literature on transforming and harnessing hallucinations for creativity in LLMs. Finally, the survey discusses future research directions, emphasizing the need to further explore and refine the application of hallucinations in creative processes within LLMs. <br /> <br />[Task Supportive and Personalized Human-Large Language Model Interaction: A User Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06170) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-09 **Authors** Ben Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language model (LLM) applications, such as ChatGPT, are a powerful tool for online information-seeking (IS) and problem-solving tasks. However, users still face challenges initializing and refining prompts, and their cognitive barriers and biased perceptions further impede task completion. These issues reflect broader challenges identified within the fields of IS and interactive information retrieval (IIR). To address these, our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human-ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT-like platform integrated with supportive functions, including perception articulation, prompt suggestion, and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations, reduce cognitive loads, better refine prompts, and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user-centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human-LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users. <br /> <br />[Similarity-based Neighbor Selection for Graph LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03720) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-06 **Authors** Rui Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges for direct processing by Language Learning Models (LLMs), yet their extensive commonsense knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities offer great promise for node classification in TAGs. Prior research in this field has grappled with issues such as over-squashing, heterophily, and ineffective graph information integration, further compounded by inconsistencies in dataset partitioning and underutilization of advanced LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Similarity-based Neighbor Selection (SNS). Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional GNN methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple prompt interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in LLM applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ruili33/SNS. <br /> <br />[Mathemyths: Leveraging Large Language Models to Teach Mathematical Language through Child-AI Co-Creative Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01927) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-26 **Authors** Chao Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Mathematical language is a cornerstone of a child's mathematical development, and children can effectively acquire this language through storytelling with a knowledgeable and engaging partner. In this study, we leverage the recent advances in large language models to conduct free-form, creative conversations with children. Consequently, we developed Mathemyths, a joint storytelling agent that takes turns co-creating stories with children while integrating mathematical terms into the evolving narrative. This paper details our development process, illustrating how prompt-engineering can optimize LLMs for educational contexts. Through a user study involving 35 children aged 4-8 years, our results suggest that when children interacted with Mathemyths, their learning of mathematical language was comparable to those who co-created stories with a human partner. However, we observed differences in how children engaged with co-creation partners of different natures. Overall, we believe that LLM applications, like Mathemyths, offer children a unique conversational experience pertaining to focused learning objectives. <br /> <br />[Building Guardrails for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01822) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-29 **Authors** Yi Dong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to identify and mitigate their risks, especially when the risks can have profound impacts on human users and societies. Guardrails, which filter the inputs or outputs of LLMs, have emerged as a core safeguarding technology. This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions. Drawing on robust evidence from previous research, we advocate for a systematic approach to construct guardrails for LLMs, based on comprehensive consideration of diverse contexts across various LLMs applications. We propose employing socio-technical methods through collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team to pinpoint precise technical requirements, exploring advanced neural-symbolic implementations to embrace the complexity of the requirements, and developing verification and testing to ensure the utmost quality of the final product. <br /> <br />[Reducing Selection Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01740) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-15 **Authors** J. E. Eicher et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and claude-instant-1.2 are vital in interpreting and executing semantic tasks. Unfortunately, these models' inherent biases adversely affect their performance Particularly affected is object selection from lists; a fundamental operation in digital navigation and decision-making. This research critically examines these biases and quantifies the effects on a representative list selection task. To explore these biases, we experiment manipulating temperature, list length, object identity, object type, prompt complexity, and model. We isolated and measured the influence of the biases on selection behavior. Our findings show that bias structure is strongly dependent on the model, with object type modulating the magnitude of the effect. With a strong primacy effect, causing the first objects in a list to be disproportionately represented in outputs. The usage of guard rails, a prompt engineering method of ensuring a response structure, increases bias and decreases instruction adherence when to a selection task. The bias is ablated when the guard rail step is separated from the list sampling step, lowering the complexity of each individual task. We provide LLM applications and theoretically suggest that LLMs experience a form of cognitive load that is compensated for with bias. <br /> <br />[APT-Pipe: A Prompt-Tuning Tool for Social Data Annotation using ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01697) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-20 **Authors** Yiming Zhu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent research has highlighted the potential of LLM applications, like ChatGPT, for performing label annotation on social computing text. However, it is already well known that performance hinges on the quality of the input prompts. To address this, there has been a flurry of research into prompt tuning -- techniques and guidelines that attempt to improve the quality of prompts. Yet these largely rely on manual effort and prior knowledge of the dataset being annotated. To address this limitation, we propose APT-Pipe, an automated prompt-tuning pipeline. APT-Pipe aims to automatically tune prompts to enhance ChatGPT's text classification performance on any given dataset. We implement APT-Pipe and test it across twelve distinct text classification datasets. We find that prompts tuned by APT-Pipe help ChatGPT achieve higher weighted F1-score on nine out of twelve experimented datasets, with an improvement of 7.01% on average. We further highlight APT-Pipe's flexibility as a framework by showing how it can be extended to support additional tuning mechanisms. <br /> <br />[DrugAssist: A Large Language Model for Molecule Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10334) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-28 **Authors** Geyan Ye et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recently, the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks has attracted an increasing number of attempts to apply LLMs in drug discovery. However, molecule optimization, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, is currently an area that has seen little involvement from LLMs. Most of existing approaches focus solely on capturing the underlying patterns in chemical structures provided by the data, without taking advantage of expert feedback. These non-interactive approaches overlook the fact that the drug discovery process is actually one that requires the integration of expert experience and iterative refinement. To address this gap, we propose DrugAssist, an interactive molecule optimization model which performs optimization through human-machine dialogue by leveraging LLM's strong interactivity and generalizability. DrugAssist has achieved leading results in both single and multiple property optimization, simultaneously showcasing immense potential in transferability and iterative optimization. In addition, we publicly release a large instruction-based dataset called MolOpt-Instructions for fine-tuning language models on molecule optimization tasks. We have made our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/blazerye/DrugAssist, which we hope to pave the way for future research in LLMs' application for drug discovery. <br /> <br />[DistServe: Disaggregating Prefill and Decoding for Goodput-optimized Large Language Model Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09670) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-06 **Authors** Yinmin Zhong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> DistServe improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) serving by disaggregating the prefill and decoding computation. Existing LLM serving systems colocate the two phases and batch the computation of prefill and decoding across all users and requests. We find that this strategy not only leads to strong prefill-decoding interferences but also couples the resource allocation and parallelism plans for both phases. LLM applications often emphasize individual latency for each phase: time to first token (TTFT) for the prefill phase and time per output token (TPOT) of each request for the decoding phase. In the presence of stringent latency requirements, existing systems have to prioritize one latency over the other, or over-provision compute resources to meet both.   DistServe assigns prefill and decoding computation to different GPUs, hence eliminating prefill-decoding interferences. Given the application's TTFT and TPOT requirements, DistServe co-optimizes the resource allocation and parallelism strategy tailored for each phase. DistServe also places the two phases according to the serving cluster's bandwidth to minimize the communication caused by disaggregation. As a result, DistServe significantly improves LLM serving performance in terms of the maximum rate that can be served within both TTFT and TPOT constraints on each GPU. Our evaluations show that on various popular LLMs, applications, and latency requirements, DistServe can serve 7.4x more requests or 12.6x tighter SLO, compared to state-of-the-art systems, while staying within latency constraints for > 90% of requests. <br /> <br />[Graph database while computationally efficient filters out quickly the ESG integrated equities in investment management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07483) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-15 **Authors** Partha Sen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Design/methodology/approach This research evaluated the databases of SQL, No-SQL and graph databases to compare and contrast efficiency and performance.

Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: a Scoping Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02984) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-21 **Authors** Yining Hua et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Social Networks: Applications, Challenges, and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02575) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-04 **Authors** Jingying Zeng et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the way people generate, explore, and engage with content. We study how we can develop LLM applications for online social networks. Despite LLMs' successes in other domains, it is challenging to develop LLM-based products for social networks for numerous reasons, and it has been relatively under-reported in the research community. We categorize LLM applications for social networks into three categories. First is knowledge tasks where users want to find new knowledge and information, such as search and question-answering. Second is entertainment tasks where users want to consume interesting content, such as getting entertaining notification content. Third is foundational tasks that need to be done to moderate and operate the social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring. For each task, we share the challenges we found, solutions we developed, and lessons we learned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive paper about developing LLM applications for social networks. <br /> <br />[RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-17 **Authors** Cheng Niu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual cases and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. Furthermore, we show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive level of performance in hallucination detection when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models such as GPT-4. <br /> <br />[ComplexityNet: Increasing LLM Inference Efficiency by Learning Task Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11511) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-30 **Authors** Henry Bae et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We present ComplexityNet, a streamlined language model designed for assessing task complexity. This model predicts the likelihood of accurate output by various language models, each with different capabilities. Our initial application of ComplexityNet involves the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) dataset. We pioneered the creation of the first set of labels to define task complexity. ComplexityNet achieved a notable 79% accuracy in determining task complexity, a significant improvement over the 34% accuracy of the original, non fine-tuned model. Furthermore, ComplexityNet effectively reduces computational resource usage by 90% compared to using the highest complexity model, while maintaining a high code generation accuracy of 86.7%. This study demonstrates that fine-tuning smaller models to categorize tasks based on their complexity can lead to a more balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the use of Large Language Models. Our findings suggest a promising direction for optimizing LLM applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. <br /> <br />[RJUA-QA: A Comprehensive QA Dataset for Urology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09785) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-07 **Authors** Shiwei Lyu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We introduce RJUA-QA, a novel medical dataset for question answering (QA) and reasoning with clinical evidence, contributing to bridge the gap between general large language models (LLMs) and medical-specific LLM applications. RJUA-QA is derived from realistic clinical scenarios and aims to facilitate LLMs in generating reliable diagnostic and advice. The dataset contains 2,132 curated Question-Context-Answer pairs, corresponding about 25,000 diagnostic records and clinical cases. The dataset covers 67 common urological disease categories, where the disease coverage exceeds 97.6\% of the population seeking medical services in urology. Each data instance in RJUA-QA comprises: (1) a question mirroring real patient to inquiry about clinical symptoms and medical conditions, (2) a context including comprehensive expert knowledge, serving as a reference for medical examination and diagnosis, (3) a doctor response offering the diagnostic conclusion and suggested examination guidance, (4) a diagnosed clinical disease as the recommended diagnostic outcome, and (5) clinical advice providing recommendations for medical examination. RJUA-QA is the first medical QA dataset for clinical reasoning over the patient inquiries, where expert-level knowledge and experience are required for yielding diagnostic conclusions and medical examination advice. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted to evaluate the performance of both medical-specific and general LLMs on the RJUA-QA dataset. Our data is are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/alipay/RJU_Ant_QA}. <br /> <br />[ChatSOS: LLM-based knowledge Q&A system for safety engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08629) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-14 **Authors** Haiyang Tang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have notably propelled natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, demonstrating significant potential in safety engineering applications. Despite these advancements, LLMs face constraints in processing specialized tasks, attributed to factors such as corpus size, input processing limitations, and privacy concerns. Obtaining useful information from reliable sources in a limited time is crucial for LLM. Addressing this, our study introduces an LLM-based Q&A system for safety engineering, enhancing the comprehension and response accuracy of the model. We employed prompt engineering to incorporate external knowledge databases, thus enriching the LLM with up-to-date and reliable information. The system analyzes historical incident reports through statistical methods, utilizes vector embedding to construct a vector database, and offers an efficient similarity-based search functionality. Our findings indicate that the integration of external knowledge significantly augments the capabilities of LLM for in-depth problem analysis and autonomous task assignment. It effectively summarizes accident reports and provides pertinent recommendations. This integration approach not only expands LLM applications in safety engineering but also sets a precedent for future developments towards automation and intelligent systems. <br /> <br />[METAL: Metamorphic Testing Framework for Analyzing Large-Language Model Qualities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06056) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-11 **Authors** Sangwon Hyun et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large-Language Models (LLMs) have shifted the paradigm of natural language data processing. However, their black-boxed and probabilistic characteristics can lead to potential risks in the quality of outputs in diverse LLM applications. Recent studies have tested Quality Attributes (QAs), such as robustness or fairness, of LLMs by generating adversarial input texts. However, existing studies have limited their coverage of QAs and tasks in LLMs and are difficult to extend. Additionally, these studies have only used one evaluation metric, Attack Success Rate (ASR), to assess the effectiveness of their approaches. We propose a MEtamorphic Testing for Analyzing LLMs (METAL) framework to address these issues by applying Metamorphic Testing (MT) techniques. This approach facilitates the systematic testing of LLM qualities by defining Metamorphic Relations (MRs), which serve as modularized evaluation metrics. The METAL framework can automatically generate hundreds of MRs from templates that cover various QAs and tasks. In addition, we introduced novel metrics that integrate the ASR method into the semantic qualities of text to assess the effectiveness of MRs accurately. Through the experiments conducted with three prominent LLMs, we have confirmed that the METAL framework effectively evaluates essential QAs on primary LLM tasks and reveals the quality risks in LLMs. Moreover, the newly proposed metrics can guide the optimal MRs for testing each task and suggest the most effective method for generating MRs. <br /> <br />[A Survey on Large Language Model (LLM) Security and Privacy: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02003) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-20 **Authors** Yifan Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation. They possess deep language comprehension, human-like text generation capabilities, contextual awareness, and robust problem-solving skills, making them invaluable in various domains (e.g., search engines, customer support, translation). In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into "The Good" (beneficial LLM applications), "The Bad" (offensive applications), and "The Ugly" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts. For example, Research on model and parameter extraction attacks is limited and often theoretical, hindered by LLM parameter scale and confidentiality. Safe instruction tuning, a recent development, requires more exploration. We hope that our work can shed light on the LLMs' potential to both bolster and jeopardize cybersecurity. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models for Networking: Applications, Enabling Techniques, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17474) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-29 **Authors** Yudong Huang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The rapid evolution of network technologies and the growing complexity of network tasks necessitate a paradigm shift in how networks are designed, configured, and managed. With a wealth of knowledge and expertise, large language models (LLMs) are one of the most promising candidates. This paper aims to pave the way for constructing domain-adapted LLMs for networking. Firstly, we present potential LLM applications for vertical network fields and showcase the mapping from natural language to network language. Then, several enabling technologies are investigated, including parameter-efficient finetuning and prompt engineering. The insight is that language understanding and tool usage are both required for network LLMs. Driven by the idea of embodied intelligence, we propose the ChatNet, a domain-adapted network LLM framework with access to various external network tools. ChatNet can reduce the time required for burdensome network planning tasks significantly, leading to a substantial improvement in efficiency. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are highlighted. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models Suffer From Their Own Output: An Analysis of the Self-Consuming Training Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16822) <br /> **Date** 2023-11-28 **Authors** Martin Briesch et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLM) have become state of the art in many benchmarks and conversational LLM applications like ChatGPT are now widely used by the public. Those LLMs can be used to generate large amounts of content which is posted on the internet to various platforms. As LLMs are trained on datasets usually collected from the internet, this LLM-generated content might be used to train the next generation of LLMs. Therefore, a self-consuming training loop emerges in which new LLM generations are trained on the output from the previous generations. We empirically study this self-consuming training loop using a novel dataset to analytically and accurately measure quality and diversity of generated outputs. We find that this self-consuming training loop initially improves both quality and diversity. However, after a few generations the output inevitably degenerates in diversity. We find that the rate of degeneration depends on the proportion of real and generated data. <br /> <br />[A Security Risk Taxonomy for Prompt-Based Interaction With Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11415) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-23 **Authors** Erik Derner et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) permeate more and more applications, an assessment of their associated security risks becomes increasingly necessary. The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a gap in current research by specifically focusing on security risks posed by LLMs within the prompt-based interaction scheme, which extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication pipeline and categorizes the attacks by target and attack type alongside the commonly used confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and trustworthiness. <br /> <br />[The Ups and Downs of Large Language Model Inference with Vocabulary Trimming by Language Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09709) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-28 **Authors** Nikolay Bogoychev et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Deploying large language models (LLMs) encounters challenges due to intensive computational and memory requirements. Our research examines vocabulary trimming (VT) inspired by restricting embedding entries to the language of interest to bolster time and memory efficiency. While such modifications have been proven effective in tasks like machine translation, tailoring them to LLMs demands specific modifications given the diverse nature of LLM applications. We apply two language heuristics to trim the full vocabulary - Unicode-based script filtering and corpus-based selection - to different LLM families and sizes. The methods are straightforward, interpretable, and easy to implement. It is found that VT reduces the memory usage of small models by nearly 50% and has an upper bound of 25% improvement in generation speed. Yet, we reveal the limitations of these methods in that they do not perform consistently well for each language with diminishing returns in larger models. <br /> <br />[How Well Do Large Language Models Truly Ground?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09069) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-29 **Authors** Hyunji Lee et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> To reduce issues like hallucinations and lack of control in Large Language Models (LLMs), a common method is to generate responses by grounding on external contexts given as input, known as knowledge-augmented models. However, previous research often narrowly defines "grounding" as just having the correct answer, which does not ensure the reliability of the entire response. To overcome this, we propose a stricter definition of grounding: a model is truly grounded if it (1) fully utilizes the necessary knowledge from the provided context, and (2) stays within the limits of that knowledge. We introduce a new dataset and a grounding metric to evaluate model capability under the definition. We perform experiments across 25 LLMs of different sizes and training methods and provide insights into factors that influence grounding performance. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how to improve grounding capabilities and suggest an area of improvement toward more reliable and controllable LLM applications. <br /> <br />[A Robust Semantics-based Watermark for Large Language Model against Paraphrasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08721) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-01 **Authors** Jie Ren et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have show great ability in various natural language tasks. However, there are concerns that LLMs are possible to be used improperly or even illegally. To prevent the malicious usage of LLMs, detecting LLM-generated text becomes crucial in the deployment of LLM applications. Watermarking is an effective strategy to detect the LLM-generated content by encoding a pre-defined secret watermark to facilitate the detection process. However, the majority of existing watermark methods leverage the simple hashes of precedent tokens to partition vocabulary. Such watermark can be easily eliminated by paraphrase and correspondingly the detection effectiveness will be greatly compromised. Thus, to enhance the robustness against paraphrase, we propose a semantics-based watermark framework SemaMark. It leverages the semantics as an alternative to simple hashes of tokens since the paraphrase will likely preserve the semantic meaning of the sentences. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SemaMark under different paraphrases. <br /> <br />[Unifying the Perspectives of NLP and Software Engineering: A Survey on Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07989) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-26 **Authors** Ziyin Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> In this work we systematically review the recent advancements in software engineering with language models, covering 70+ models, 40+ evaluation tasks, 180+ datasets, and 900 related works. Unlike previous works, we integrate software engineering (SE) with natural language processing (NLP) by discussing the perspectives of both sides: SE applies language models for development automation, while NLP adopts SE tasks for language model evaluation. We break down code processing models into general language models represented by the GPT family and specialized models that are specifically pretrained on code, often with tailored objectives. We discuss the relations and differences between these models, and highlight the historical transition of code modeling from statistical models and RNNs to pretrained Transformers and LLMs, which is exactly the same course that had been taken by NLP. We also go beyond programming and review LLMs' application in other software engineering activities including requirement engineering, testing, deployment, and operations in an endeavor to provide a global view of NLP in SE, and identify key challenges and potential future directions in this domain. We keep the survey open and updated on GitHub at https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Awesome-Code-LLM. <br /> <br />[Evaluating LLMs on Document-Based QA: Exact Answer Selection and Numerical Extraction using Cogtale dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07878) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-03 **Authors** Zafaryab Rasool et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Document-based Question-Answering (QA) tasks are crucial for precise information retrieval. While some existing work focus on evaluating large language models performance on retrieving and answering questions from documents, assessing the LLMs performance on QA types that require exact answer selection from predefined options and numerical extraction is yet to be fully assessed. In this paper, we specifically focus on this underexplored context and conduct empirical analysis of LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) on question types, including single-choice, yes-no, multiple-choice, and number extraction questions from documents in zero-shot setting. We use the CogTale dataset for evaluation, which provide human expert-tagged responses, offering a robust benchmark for precision and factual grounding. We found that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can precisely answer many single-choice and yes-no questions given relevant context, demonstrating their efficacy in information retrieval tasks. However, their performance diminishes when confronted with multiple-choice and number extraction formats, lowering the overall performance of the model on this task, indicating that these models may not yet be sufficiently reliable for the task. This limits the applications of LLMs on applications demanding precise information extraction from documents, such as meta-analysis tasks. These findings hinge on the assumption that the retrievers furnish pertinent context necessary for accurate responses, emphasizing the need for further research. Our work offers a framework for ongoing dataset evaluation, ensuring that LLM applications for information retrieval and document analysis continue to meet evolving standards. <br /> <br />[Knowledgeable Preference Alignment for LLMs in Domain-specific Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06503) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-10 **Authors** Yichi Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Deploying large language models (LLMs) to real scenarios for domain-specific question answering (QA) is a key thrust for LLM applications, which poses numerous challenges, especially in ensuring that responses are both accommodating to user requirements and appropriately leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. They are the two major difficulties for LLM application as vanilla fine-tuning falls short of addressing. Combining these requirements, we conceive of them as the requirement for the model's preference to be harmoniously aligned with humans'. Thus, we introduce Knowledgeable Preference AlignmenT (KnowPAT), which constructs two kinds of preference sets to tackle the two issues. Besides, we design a new alignment objective to align the LLM preference with different human preferences uniformly, aiming to optimize LLM performance in real-world, domain-specific QA settings. Adequate experiments and comprehensive comparisons with 15 baseline methods illustrate that our KnowPAT is a superior pipeline for real-scenario domain-specific QA with LLMs. <br /> <br />[ChipNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-04 **Authors** Mingjie Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, we instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: domain-adaptive tokenization, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, model alignment with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models. We evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Our evaluations demonstrate that domain-adaptive pretraining of language models, can lead to superior performance in domain related downstream tasks compared to their base LLaMA2 counterparts, without degradations in generic capabilities. In particular, our largest model, ChipNeMo-70B, outperforms the highly capable GPT-4 on two of our use cases, namely engineering assistant chatbot and EDA scripts generation, while exhibiting competitive performance on bug summarization and analysis. These results underscore the potential of domain-specific customization for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in specialized applications. <br /> <br />[RCAgent: Cloud Root Cause Analysis by Autonomous Agents with Tool-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16340) <br /> **Date** 2024-08-02 **Authors** Zefan Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language model (LLM) applications in cloud root cause analysis (RCA) have been actively explored recently. However, current methods are still reliant on manual workflow settings and do not unleash LLMs' decision-making and environment interaction capabilities. We present RCAgent, a tool-augmented LLM autonomous agent framework for practical and privacy-aware industrial RCA usage. Running on an internally deployed model rather than GPT families, RCAgent is capable of free-form data collection and comprehensive analysis with tools. Our framework combines a variety of enhancements, including a unique Self-Consistency for action trajectories, and a suite of methods for context management, stabilization, and importing domain knowledge. Our experiments show RCAgent's evident and consistent superiority over ReAct across all aspects of RCA -- predicting root causes, solutions, evidence, and responsibilities -- and tasks covered or uncovered by current rules, as validated by both automated metrics and human evaluations. Furthermore, RCAgent has already been integrated into the diagnosis and issue discovery workflow of the Real-time Compute Platform for Apache Flink of Alibaba Cloud. <br /> <br />[PoisonPrompt: Backdoor Attack on Prompt-based Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12439) <br /> **Date** 2023-12-18 **Authors** Hongwei Yao et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Prompts have significantly improved the performance of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) on various downstream tasks recently, making them increasingly indispensable for a diverse range of LLM application scenarios. However, the backdoor vulnerability, a serious security threat that can maliciously alter the victim model's normal predictions, has not been sufficiently explored for prompt-based LLMs. In this paper, we present POISONPROMPT, a novel backdoor attack capable of successfully compromising both hard and soft prompt-based LLMs. We evaluate the effectiveness, fidelity, and robustness of POISONPROMPT through extensive experiments on three popular prompt methods, using six datasets and three widely used LLMs. Our findings highlight the potential security threats posed by backdoor attacks on prompt-based LLMs and emphasize the need for further research in this area. <br /> <br />[NeMo Guardrails: A Toolkit for Controllable and Safe LLM Applications with Programmable Rails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10501) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-16 **Authors** Traian Rebedea et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems. Guardrails (or rails for short) are a specific way of controlling the output of an LLM, such as not talking about topics considered harmful, following a predefined dialogue path, using a particular language style, and more. There are several mechanisms that allow LLM providers and developers to add guardrails that are embedded into a specific model at training, e.g. using model alignment. Differently, using a runtime inspired from dialogue management, NeMo Guardrails allows developers to add programmable rails to LLM applications - these are user-defined, independent of the underlying LLM, and interpretable. Our initial results show that the proposed approach can be used with several LLM providers to develop controllable and safe LLM applications using programmable rails. <br /> <br />[Chatmap : Large Language Model Interaction with Cartographic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01429) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-28 **Authors** Eren Unlu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The swift advancement and widespread availability of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), complemented by robust fine-tuning methodologies, have catalyzed their adaptation for innovative and industrious applications. Enabling LLMs to recognize and interpret geospatial data, while offering a linguistic access to vast cartographic datasets, is of significant importance. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most ambitious open-source global initiative offering detailed urban and rural geographic data, curated by a community of over 10 million contributors, which constitutes a great potential for LLM applications. In this study, we demonstrate the proof of concept and details of the process of fine-tuning a relatively small scale (1B parameters) LLM with a relatively small artificial dataset curated by a more capable teacher model, in order to provide a linguistic interface to the OSM data of an arbitrary urban region. Through this interface, users can inquire about a location's attributes, covering a wide spectrum of concepts, such as its touristic appeal or the potential profitability of various businesses in that vicinity. The study aims to provide an initial guideline for such generative artificial intelligence (AI) adaptations and demonstrate early signs of useful emerging abilities in this context even in minimal computational settings. The embeddings of artificially curated prompts including OSM data are also investigated in detail, which might be instrumental for potential geospatially aware urban Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. <br /> <br />["I'd Like to Have an Argument, Please": Argumentative Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16938) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-10 **Authors** Adrian de Wynter et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> We evaluate two large language models (LLMs) ability to perform argumentative reasoning. We experiment with argument mining (AM) and argument pair extraction (APE), and evaluate the LLMs' ability to recognize arguments under progressively more abstract input and output (I/O) representations (e.g., arbitrary label sets, graphs, etc.). Unlike the well-known evaluation of prompt phrasings, abstraction evaluation retains the prompt's phrasing but tests reasoning capabilities. We find that scoring-wise the LLMs match or surpass the SOTA in AM and APE, and under certain I/O abstractions LLMs perform well, even beating chain-of-thought--we call this symbolic prompting. However, statistical analysis on the LLMs outputs when subject to small, yet still human-readable, alterations in the I/O representations (e.g., asking for BIO tags as opposed to line numbers) showed that the models are not performing reasoning. This suggests that LLM applications to some tasks, such as data labelling and paper reviewing, must be done with care. <br /> <br />[People's Perceptions Toward Bias and Related Concepts in Large Language Models: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14504) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-03 **Authors** Lu Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large language models (LLMs) have brought breakthroughs in tasks including translation, summarization, information retrieval, and language generation, gaining growing interest in the CHI community. Meanwhile, the literature shows researchers' controversial perceptions about the efficacy, ethics, and intellectual abilities of LLMs. However, we do not know how people perceive LLMs that are pervasive in everyday tools, specifically regarding their experience with LLMs around bias, stereotypes, social norms, or safety. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to understand what empirical insights papers have gathered about people's perceptions toward LLMs. From a total of 231 retrieved papers, we full-text reviewed 15 papers that recruited human evaluators to assess their experiences with LLMs. We report different biases and related concepts investigated by these studies, four broader LLM application areas, the evaluators' perceptions toward LLMs' performances including advantages, biases, and conflicting perceptions, factors influencing these perceptions, and concerns about LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Machine-assisted mixed methods: augmenting humanities and social sciences with artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14379) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-24 **Authors** Andres Karjus et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and social sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks previously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution proposes a systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise, machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to transparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased as proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference and text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre composition in literature and film; social network inference, automated lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural analytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human) annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace, but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have arguably never been more critical. <br /> <br />[AnglE-optimized Text Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12871) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-17 **Authors** Xianming Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks. The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle optimization in STS. <br /> <br />[Redefining Qualitative Analysis in the AI Era: Utilizing ChatGPT for Efficient Thematic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10771) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-28 **Authors** He Zhang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> AI tools, particularly large-scale language model (LLM) based applications such as ChatGPT, have the potential to simplify qualitative research. Through semi-structured interviews with seventeen participants, we identified challenges and concerns in integrating ChatGPT into the qualitative analysis process. Collaborating with thirteen qualitative researchers, we developed a framework for designing prompts to enhance the effectiveness of ChatGPT in thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that improving transparency, providing guidance on prompts, and strengthening users' understanding of LLMs' capabilities significantly enhance the users' ability to interact with ChatGPT. We also discovered and revealed the reasons behind researchers' shift in attitude towards ChatGPT from negative to positive. This research not only highlights the importance of well-designed prompts in LLM applications but also offers reflections for qualitative researchers on the perception of AI's role. Finally, we emphasize the potential ethical risks and the impact of constructing AI ethical expectations by researchers, particularly those who are novices, on future research and AI development. <br /> <br />[Hide and Seek (HaS): A Lightweight Framework for Prompt Privacy Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03057) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-06 **Authors** Yu Chen et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Numerous companies have started offering services based on large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, which inevitably raises privacy concerns as users' prompts are exposed to the model provider. Previous research on secure reasoning using multi-party computation (MPC) has proven to be impractical for LLM applications due to its time-consuming and communication-intensive nature. While lightweight anonymization techniques can protect private information in prompts through substitution or masking, they fail to recover sensitive data replaced in the LLM-generated results. In this paper, we expand the application scenarios of anonymization techniques by training a small local model to de-anonymize the LLM's returned results with minimal computational overhead. We introduce the HaS framework, where "H(ide)" and "S(eek)" represent its two core processes: hiding private entities for anonymization and seeking private entities for de-anonymization, respectively. To quantitatively assess HaS's privacy protection performance, we propose both black-box and white-box adversarial models. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to evaluate HaS's usability in translation and classification tasks. The experimental findings demonstrate that the HaS framework achieves an optimal balance between privacy protection and utility. <br /> <br />[A Study on the Implementation of Generative AI Services Using an Enterprise Data-Based LLM Application Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01105) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-18 **Authors** Cheonsu Jeong et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study presents a method for implementing generative AI services by utilizing the Large Language Models (LLM) application architecture.

The investigation delves into strategies for mitigating the issue of inadequate data, offering tailored solutions. The study delves into the efficacy of employing fine-tuning techniques and direct document integration to alleviate data insufficiency. A significant contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which tackles the aforementioned challenges. The RAG model is carefully designed to enhance information storage and retrieval processes, ensuring improved content generation. The research elucidates the key phases of the information storage and retrieval methodology underpinned by the RAG model. A comprehensive analysis of these steps is undertaken, emphasizing their significance in addressing the scarcity of data. The study highlights the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing its applicability through illustrative instances. By implementing the RAG model for information storage and retrieval, the research not only contributes to a deeper comprehension of generative AI technology but also facilitates its practical usability within enterprises utilizing LLMs. This work holds substantial value in advancing the field of generative AI, offering insights into enhancing data-driven content generation and fostering active utilization of LLM-based services within corporate settings. <br /> <br />[ChatGPT-HealthPrompt. Harnessing the Power of XAI in Prompt-Based Healthcare Decision Support using ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09731) <br /> **Date** 2023-08-17 **Authors** Fatemeh Nazary et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> This study presents an innovative approach to the application of large language models (LLMs) in clinical decision-making, focusing on OpenAI's ChatGPT. Our approach introduces the use of contextual prompts-strategically designed to include task description, feature description, and crucially, integration of domain knowledge-for high-quality binary classification tasks even in data-scarce scenarios. The novelty of our work lies in the utilization of domain knowledge, obtained from high-performing interpretable ML models, and its seamless incorporation into prompt design. By viewing these ML models as medical experts, we extract key insights on feature importance to aid in decision-making processes. This interplay of domain knowledge and AI holds significant promise in creating a more insightful diagnostic tool.   Additionally, our research explores the dynamics of zero-shot and few-shot prompt learning based on LLMs. By comparing the performance of OpenAI's ChatGPT with traditional supervised ML models in different data conditions, we aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of prompt engineering strategies under varied data availability. In essence, this paper bridges the gap between AI and healthcare, proposing a novel methodology for LLMs application in clinical decision support systems. It highlights the transformative potential of effective prompt design, domain knowledge integration, and flexible learning approaches in enhancing automated decision-making. <br /> <br />[AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-03 **Authors** Qingyun Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> AutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using AutoGen, developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc. <br /> <br />[A Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of LLM-Based Explainable Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05487) <br /> **Date** 2024-07-02 **Authors** Sungmin Kang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Fault Localization (FL), in which a developer seeks to identify which part of the code is malfunctioning and needs to be fixed, is a recurring challenge in debugging. To reduce developer burden, many automated FL techniques have been proposed. However, prior work has noted that existing techniques fail to provide rationales for the suggested locations, hindering developer adoption of these techniques. With this in mind, we propose AutoFL, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based FL technique that generates an explanation of the bug along with a suggested fault location. AutoFL prompts an LLM to use function calls to navigate a repository, so that it can effectively localize faults over a large software repository and overcome the limit of the LLM context length. Extensive experiments on 798 real-world bugs in Java and Python reveal AutoFL improves method-level acc@1 by up to 233.3% over baselines. Furthermore, developers were interviewed on their impression of AutoFL-generated explanations, showing that developers generally liked the natural language explanations of AutoFL, and that they preferred reading a few, high-quality explanations instead of many. <br /> <br />[Retrieval Augmented Generation and Representative Vector Summarization for large unstructured textual data in Medical Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00479) <br /> **Date** 2023-08-01 **Authors** S. S. Manathunga et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models are increasingly being used for various tasks including content generation and as chatbots. Despite their impressive performances in general tasks, LLMs need to be aligned when applying for domain specific tasks to mitigate the problems of hallucination and producing harmful answers. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows to easily attach and manipulate a non-parametric knowledgebases to LLMs. Applications of RAG in the field of medical education are discussed in this paper. A combined extractive and abstractive summarization method for large unstructured textual data using representative vectors is proposed. <br /> <br />[Towards Codable Watermarking for Injecting Multi-bits Information to LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15992) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-03 **Authors** Lean Wang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As large language models (LLMs) generate texts with increasing fluency and realism, there is a growing need to identify the source of texts to prevent the abuse of LLMs. Text watermarking techniques have proven reliable in distinguishing whether a text is generated by LLMs by injecting hidden patterns. However, we argue that existing LLM watermarking methods are encoding-inefficient and cannot flexibly meet the diverse information encoding needs (such as encoding model version, generation time, user id, etc.). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the topic of Codable Text Watermarking for LLMs (CTWL) that allows text watermarks to carry multi-bit customizable information. First of all, we study the taxonomy of LLM watermarking technologies and give a mathematical formulation for CTWL. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation system for CTWL: (1) watermarking success rate, (2) robustness against various corruptions, (3) coding rate of payload information, (4) encoding and decoding efficiency, (5) impacts on the quality of the generated text. To meet the requirements of these non-Pareto-improving metrics, we follow the most prominent vocabulary partition-based watermarking direction, and devise an advanced CTWL method named Balance-Marking. The core idea of our method is to use a proxy language model to split the vocabulary into probability-balanced parts, thereby effectively maintaining the quality of the watermarked text. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/codable-watermarking-for-llm. <br /> <br />[Development of the ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence and Natural Large Language Models for Accountable Reporting and Use (CANGARU) Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08974) <br /> **Date** 2023-07-18 **Authors** Giovanni E. Cacciamani et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> The swift progress and ubiquitous adoption of Generative AI (GAI), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have spurred queries about their ethical application, use, and disclosure in scholarly research and scientific productions. A few publishers and journals have recently created their own sets of rules; however, the absence of a unified approach may lead to a 'Babel Tower Effect,' potentially resulting in confusion rather than desired standardization. In response to this, we present the ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Large Language Models for Accountable Reporting and Use Guidelines (CANGARU) initiative, with the aim of fostering a cross-disciplinary global inclusive consensus on the ethical use, disclosure, and proper reporting of GAI/GPT/LLM technologies in academia. The present protocol consists of four distinct parts: a) an ongoing systematic review of GAI/GPT/LLM applications to understand the linked ideas, findings, and reporting standards in scholarly research, and to formulate guidelines for its use and disclosure, b) a bibliometric analysis of existing author guidelines in journals that mention GAI/GPT/LLM, with the goal of evaluating existing guidelines, analyzing the disparity in their recommendations, and identifying common rules that can be brought into the Delphi consensus process, c) a Delphi survey to establish agreement on the items for the guidelines, ensuring principled GAI/GPT/LLM use, disclosure, and reporting in academia, and d) the subsequent development and dissemination of the finalized guidelines and their supplementary explanation and elaboration documents. <br /> <br />[Concept-Oriented Deep Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17089) <br /> **Date** 2023-09-19 **Authors** Daniel T. Chang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successfully used in many natural-language tasks and applications including text generation and AI chatbots. They also are a promising new technology for concept-oriented deep learning (CODL). However, the prerequisite is that LLMs understand concepts and ensure conceptual consistency. We discuss these in this paper, as well as major uses of LLMs for CODL including concept extraction from text, concept graph extraction from text, and concept learning. Human knowledge consists of both symbolic (conceptual) knowledge and embodied (sensory) knowledge. Text-only LLMs, however, can represent only symbolic (conceptual) knowledge. Multimodal LLMs, on the other hand, are capable of representing the full range (conceptual and sensory) of human knowledge. We discuss conceptual understanding in visual-language LLMs, the most important multimodal LLMs, and major uses of them for CODL including concept extraction from image, concept graph extraction from image, and concept learning. While uses of LLMs for CODL are valuable standalone, they are particularly valuable as part of LLM applications such as AI chatbots. <br /> <br />[Empowering Molecule Discovery for Molecule-Caption Translation with Large Language Models: A ChatGPT Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06615) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-22 **Authors** Jiatong Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Molecule discovery plays a crucial role in various scientific fields, advancing the design of tailored materials and drugs. However, most of the existing methods heavily rely on domain experts, require excessive computational cost, or suffer from sub-optimal performance. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in various cross-modal tasks due to their powerful capabilities in natural language understanding, generalization, and in-context learning (ICL), which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance molecule discovery. Despite several previous works trying to apply LLMs in this task, the lack of domain-specific corpus and difficulties in training specialized LLMs still remain challenges. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based framework (MolReGPT) for molecule-caption translation, where an In-Context Few-Shot Molecule Learning paradigm is introduced to empower molecule discovery with LLMs like ChatGPT to perform their in-context learning capability without domain-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. MolReGPT leverages the principle of molecular similarity to retrieve similar molecules and their text descriptions from a local database to enable LLMs to learn the task knowledge from context examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of MolReGPT on molecule-caption translation, including molecule understanding and text-based molecule generation. Experimental results show that compared to fine-tuned models, MolReGPT outperforms MolT5-base and is comparable to MolT5-large without additional training. To the best of our knowledge, MolReGPT is the first work to leverage LLMs via in-context learning in molecule-caption translation for advancing molecule discovery. Our work expands the scope of LLM applications, as well as providing a new paradigm for molecule discovery and design. <br /> <br />[Protect Your Prompts: Protocols for IP Protection in LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06297) <br /> **Date** 2023-06-09 **Authors** M. A. van Wyk et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the rapid adoption of AI in the form of large language models (LLMs), the potential value of carefully engineered prompts has become significant. However, to realize this potential, prompts should be tradable on an open market. Since prompts are, at present, generally economically non-excludable, by virtue of their nature as text, no general competitive market has yet been established. This note discusses two protocols intended to provide protection of prompts, elevating their status as intellectual property, thus confirming the intellectual property rights of prompt engineers, and potentially supporting the flourishing of an open market for LLM prompts. <br /> <br />[On the Detectability of ChatGPT Content: Benchmarking, Methodology, and Evaluation through the Lens of Academic Writing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05524) <br /> **Date** 2024-03-18 **Authors** Zeyan Liu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With ChatGPT under the spotlight, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assist academic writing has drawn a significant amount of debate in the community. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive study of the detectability of ChatGPT-generated content within the academic literature, particularly focusing on the abstracts of scientific papers, to offer holistic support for the future development of LLM applications and policies in academia. Specifically, we first present GPABench2, a benchmarking dataset of over 2.8 million comparative samples of human-written, GPT-written, GPT-completed, and GPT-polished abstracts of scientific writing in computer science, physics, and humanities and social sciences. Second, we explore the methodology for detecting ChatGPT content. We start by examining the unsatisfactory performance of existing ChatGPT detecting tools and the challenges faced by human evaluators (including more than 240 researchers or students). We then test the hand-crafted linguistic features models as a baseline and develop a deep neural framework named CheckGPT to better capture the subtle and deep semantic and linguistic patterns in ChatGPT written literature. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the proposed CheckGPT framework in each benchmarking task over different disciplines. To evaluate the detectability of ChatGPT content, we conduct extensive experiments on the transferability, prompt engineering, and robustness of CheckGPT. <br /> <br />[Allies: Prompting Large Language Model with Beam Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14766) <br /> **Date** 2023-10-19 **Authors** Hao Sun et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> With the advance of large language models (LLMs), the research field of LLM applications becomes more and more popular and the idea of constructing pipelines to accomplish complex tasks by stacking LLM API calls come true. However, this kind of methods face two limitations: narrow information coverage and low fault tolerance. In this work, we propose a novel method called ALLIES. Given an input query, ALLIES leverages LLMs to iteratively generate new queries related to the original query, enabling an iterative reasoning process. By iteratively refining and expanding the scope of the original query, ALLIES captures and utilizes hidden knowledge that may not be directly obtainable through retrieval. We take zero-shot open-domain question answering (ODQA) as an application scene and evaluate ALLIES on the widely-used benchmarks, such as NQ, WebQ and TriviaQA. The experimental results demonstrate that ALLIES significantly outperforms other zero-shot baselines, indicating its effectiveness in tackling those challenges. Our code is available in https://github.com/microsoft/SimXNS/tree/main/ALLIES. <br /> <br />[Large Language Models Leverage External Knowledge to Extend Clinical Insight Beyond Language Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10163) <br /> **Date** 2024-01-30 **Authors** Jiageng Wu et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> $\textbf{Objectives}$: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Med-PaLM have excelled in various medical question-answering tasks. However, these English-centric models encounter challenges in non-English clinical settings, primarily due to limited clinical knowledge in respective languages, a consequence of imbalanced training corpora. We systematically evaluate LLMs in the Chinese medical context and develop a novel in-context learning framework to enhance their performance.   $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: The latest China National Medical Licensing Examination (CNMLE-2022) served as the benchmark. We collected 53 medical books and 381,149 medical questions to construct the medical knowledge base and question bank. The proposed Knowledge and Few-shot Enhancement In-context Learning (KFE) framework leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to integrate diverse external clinical knowledge sources. We evaluated KFE with ChatGPT(GPT3.5), GPT4, Baichuan2(BC2)-7B, and BC2-13B in CNMLE-2022 and investigated the effectiveness of different pathways for incorporating LLMs with medical knowledge from 7 perspectives.   $\textbf{Results}$: Directly applying ChatGPT failed to qualify for the CNMLE-2022 at a score of 51. Cooperated with the KFE, the LLMs with varying sizes yielded consistent and significant improvements. The ChatGPT's performance surged to 70.04 and GPT-4 achieved the highest score of 82.59. This surpasses the qualification threshold (60) and exceeds the average human score of 68.70. It also enabled a smaller BC2-13B to pass the examination, showcasing the great potential in low-resource settings.   $\textbf{Conclusion}$ : By synergizing medical knowledge through in-context learning, LLM can extend clinical insight beyond language barriers, significantly reducing language-related disparities of LLM applications and ensuring global benefit in healthcare. <br /> <br />[Red teaming ChatGPT via Jailbreaking: Bias, Robustness, Reliability and Toxicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12867) <br /> **Date** 2023-05-29 **Authors** Terry Yue Zhuo et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have permitted the synthesis and comprehension of coherent text in an open-ended way, therefore translating the theoretical algorithms into practical applications. The large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted businesses such as report summarization software and copywriters. Observations indicate, however, that LLMs may exhibit social prejudice and toxicity, posing ethical and societal dangers of consequences resulting from irresponsibility. Large-scale benchmarks for accountable LLMs should consequently be developed. Although several empirical investigations reveal the existence of a few ethical difficulties in advanced LLMs, there is little systematic examination and user study of the risks and harmful behaviors of current LLM usage. To further educate future efforts on constructing ethical LLMs responsibly, we perform a qualitative research method called ``red teaming'' on OpenAI's ChatGPT\footnote{In this paper, ChatGPT refers to the version released on Dec 15th.} to better understand the practical features of ethical dangers in recent LLMs. We analyze ChatGPT comprehensively from four perspectives: 1) \textit{Bias} 2) \textit{Reliability} 3) \textit{Robustness} 4) \textit{Toxicity}. In accordance with our stated viewpoints, we empirically benchmark ChatGPT on multiple sample datasets. We find that a significant number of ethical risks cannot be addressed by existing benchmarks, and hence illustrate them via additional case studies. In addition, we examine the implications of our findings on AI ethics and harmal behaviors of ChatGPT, as well as future problems and practical design considerations for responsible LLMs. We believe that our findings may give light on future efforts to determine and mitigate the ethical hazards posed by machines in LLM applications. <br /> <br />[Petals: Collaborative Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01188) <br /> **Date** 2023-03-02 **Authors** Alexander Borzunov et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Many NLP tasks benefit from using large language models (LLMs) that often have more than 100 billion parameters. With the release of BLOOM-176B and OPT-175B, everyone can download pretrained models of this scale. Still, using these models requires high-end hardware unavailable to many researchers. In some cases, LLMs can be used more affordably via RAM offloading or hosted APIs. However, these techniques have innate limitations: offloading is too slow for interactive inference, while APIs are not flexible enough for research that requires access to weights, attention or logits. In this work, we propose Petals - a system for inference and fine-tuning of large models collaboratively by joining the resources of multiple parties. We demonstrate that this strategy outperforms offloading for very large models, running inference of BLOOM-176B on consumer GPUs with $\approx$ 1 step per second, which is enough for many interactive LLM applications. Unlike most inference APIs, Petals also natively exposes hidden states of served models, allowing to train and share custom model extensions based on efficient fine-tuning methods. <br /> <br />

[A Survey on Benchmarks of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08632) <br /> **Date** 2024-09-06 **Authors** Jian Li et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry due to their remarkable performance in various applications such as visual question answering, visual perception, understanding, and reasoning. Over the past few years, significant efforts have been made to examine MLLMs from multiple perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 200 benchmarks and evaluations for MLLMs, focusing on (1)perception and understanding, (2)cognition and reasoning, (3)specific domains, (4)key capabilities, and (5)other modalities. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current evaluation methods for MLLMs and explore promising future directions. Our key argument is that evaluation should be regarded as a crucial discipline to support the development of MLLMs better.

However, the extensive model size and high training and inference costs have hindered the widespread application of MLLMs in academia and industry. Thus, studying efficient and lightweight MLLMs has enormous potential, especially in edge computing scenarios. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current efficient MLLM research and promising future directions.

Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16786) <br /> **Date** 2024-06-05 **Authors** Paul Röttger et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs. <br /> <br />[Understanding Survey Paper Taxonomy about Large Language Models via Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10409) <br /> **Date** 2024-02-16 **Authors** Jun Zhuang et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> As new research on Large Language Models (LLMs) continues, it is difficult to keep up with new research and models. To help researchers synthesize the new research many have written survey papers, but even those have become numerous. In this paper, we develop a method to automatically assign survey papers to a taxonomy. We collect the metadata of 144 LLM survey papers and explore three paradigms to classify papers within the taxonomy. Our work indicates that leveraging graph structure information on co-category graphs can significantly outperform the language models in two paradigms; pre-trained language models' fine-tuning and zero-shot/few-shot classifications using LLMs. We find that our model surpasses an average human recognition level and that fine-tuning LLMs using weak labels generated by a smaller model, such as the GCN in this study, can be more effective than using ground-truth labels, revealing the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the taxonomy classification task. <br /> <br />[Faster and Lighter LLMs: A Survey on Current Challenges and Way Forward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01799) <br /> **Date** 2024-04-24 **Authors** Arnav Chavan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Despite the impressive performance of LLMs, their widespread adoption faces challenges due to substantial computational and memory requirements during inference. Recent advancements in model compression and system-level optimization methods aim to enhance LLM inference. This survey offers an overview of these methods, emphasizing recent developments. Through experiments on LLaMA(/2)-7B, we evaluate various compression techniques, providing practical insights for efficient LLM deployment in a unified setting. The empirical analysis on LLaMA(/2)-7B highlights the effectiveness of these methods. Drawing from survey insights, we identify current limitations and discuss potential future directions to improve LLM inference efficiency. We release the codebase to reproduce the results presented in this paper at https://github.com/nyunAI/Faster-LLM-Survey <br /> <br />[Efficient Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03863) <br /> **Date** 2024-05-23 **Authors** Zhongwei Wan et.al. <br /> **Abstract** <br /> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in important tasks such as natural language understanding and language generation, and thus have the potential to make a substantial impact on our society. Such capabilities, however, come with the considerable resources they demand, highlighting the strong need to develop effective techniques for addressing their efficiency challenges. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of efficient LLMs research. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient LLMs topics from model-centric, data-centric, and framework-centric perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-LLMs-Survey. We will actively maintain the repository and incorporate new research as it emerges. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient LLMs research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field. <br /> <br />
